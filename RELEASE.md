Release Notes
=============
R2-9 (December XXX, 2019)
----
* This release **requires** ADCore R3-9 or later, because it uses the CCDMultiTrack support.
* Added new cameraSerial argument to the constructor and to andorCCDConfig to specify the camera serial number.
  This will require changing the startup script if more than 2 arguments were passed to andorCCDConfigure.
  (Hinko Kocevar).
* Added support for VSAmplitude.  (Peter Heesterman)
* Added support for MultiTrack readout.  Added "Random Track" to AndorReadoutMode. (Peter Heesterman).
* Fixed bug which caused hang when exiting. (Peter Heesterman).
* Fixed shutter bug.  setupShutter() was not being called when ADShutterMode changed (Mark Koennecke)
* Converted documentation from HTML to ReST. (Stuart Wilkins, Mark Rivers)
* Fixed error in src/Makefile for XML2.


R2-8 (July 1, 2018)
----
* Added support for new PVs in ADCore R3-3 in opi files (NumQueuedArrays, EmptyFreeList, etc.)
* Changed configure/RELEASE files for compatibility with areaDetector R3-3.
* Improved op/*/autoconvert/* files with better medm files and better converters.

R2-7 (January 31, 2018)
----
* Added support for Frame Transfer mode.  Thanks to Michael Dunning for this.
* Added support for setting the Vertical Shift Period. Thanks to Michael Dunning for this.
* Upgraded the Andor SDK version used to 2.102.3 on Linux. Thanks to Hinko Kocevar for this.
* Fixed medm adl files to improve the autoconversion to other display manager files.
* Added op/Makefile to automatically convert adl files to edl, ui, and opi files.
* Updated the edl, ui, and opi autoconvert directories to contain the conversions
  from the most recent adl files.


R2-6 (July 4, 2017)
----
* Changed from using TinyXml to libxml2.  This is used when saving SPE files.  This change was made
  because ADCore R3-0 no longer includes TinyXml and libxml2 is now available for all platforms in ADSupport.
* Fixed medm screen layout for ADCore R3-0.


R2-5 (February 19, 2017)
----
* Added support for Electron Multiplying (EM) Gain.  Thanks to Mike Dunning for this.
* Add ability to set the BaselineClamp in the Andor SDK.  Thanks to Matt Pearson for this.
* Enforce minimum values of ADShutterOpenDelay and ADShutterCloseDelay based on query of SDK.
* Fix bug when setting MinX and MinY with binning.  There was an incorrect factor of 2 present.
  Thanks to Hinko Kocevar for this fix.
* Implemented ReverseX and ReverseY.
* Fixed bug with AndorPreAmpGain; previously it was not actually calling SetPreAmpGain(). Previously the ADBase record Gain was used to set the Andor specific PreAmpGain, so to retain the previous default behaviour of x2 PreAmpGain make sure that AndorPreAmpGain is set to 2.0.
* Added support for SerialNumber, FirmwareVersion, SDKVersion, DriverVersion, and ADCoreVersion which
  were added in ADCore R2-6. 
* Added support for Full Vertical Binning (FVB) readout mode. Thanks to Hinko Kocevar for this.
* Added support for EPICS shutter control. Note: To ensure the camera shutter opens and closes, make sure the ShutterMode is set to Detector and that AndorShutterMode is set to Fully Auto.

R2-4 (September 15, 2015)
----
* Updated autoconverted .edl, .ui, and .opi files.

R2-3 (16-April-2015)
----
* Upgraded the Andor SDK version used to 2.99.3 on both Windows and Linux.
* Changed st.cmd to be compatible with ADCore R2-2. 
* Added support for mirror flippers on Shamrock spectrograph (thanks to Matthew Moore and Russell Woods).

R2-2 (12-March-2015)
----
* Upgraded the Andor SDK version used to 2.98.3 on both Windows and Linux. 
  - R2-0 through R2-1-1 used 2.90 on Windows and 2.84 on Linux.
* Added support for the Shamrock spectrographs on Linux. 
  However, andorDoc.html and the example st.cmd file were not updated
  to reflect this change, so they indicated that the Shamrock was not 
  supported on Linux.

R2-1-1 (13-Jul-2014)
----
* Added support for the Shamrock spectrographs on 64-bit Windows. 
  The notes for R2-1 are incorrect, there is 64-bit support for the Shamrock, 
  it is just a little hard to find.

R2-1 (15-Apr-2014)
----
* Added support for the Shamrock spectrographs.  
  This supports control of grating selection, center wavelength, and slit sizes.
  It is a separate driver, and is only supported on 32-bit Windows because Andor does not provide a 
  Shamrock SDK for 64-bit Windows or Linux.
* Added support for saving data in Princeton Instruments V3.0 SPE file format with XML footer.
  This is used to save calibration information from the Shamrock spectrometer.
  None of the other formats will save calibration information from the SDK, although they do from Solis.

R2-0 (24-Mar-2014)
----
* Moved the repository to [Github](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADAndor).
* Re-organized the directory structure to separate the driver library from the example IOC application.

R1-9-1 and earlier
