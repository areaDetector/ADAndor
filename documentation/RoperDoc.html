    Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This is a driver for the <a href="http://www.roperscientific.com/">Roper Scientific</a>
    detectors, which includes those from <a href="http://www.princetoninstruments.com/">
      Princeton Instruments</a> and <a href="http://www.photomet.com/">Photometrics</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The interface to the detector is via a the MicroSoft COM interface to the <b>WinView</b>
    or <b>WinSpec</b> programs that Roper provides. The term WinView will be used in
    this document to refer to either WinView or WinSpec, as they are equivalent in terms
    of the areaDetector driver. The areaDetector driver effectively "drives" WinView
    through the COM interface, performing many of the same operations that can be performed
    using the WinView GUI. The advantage of this communication mechanism is that the
    user can continue to use WinView for viewing images and for configuration operations.
    WinView is normally started before the areaDetector software is started. However,
    if the areaDetector software is started without WinView running, then WinView will
    be started in the background, and will not be visible. This may be desirable in
    some applications.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because EPICS and the WinView GUI can control many of the same parameters the user
    must be aware of the interactions between the two control systems. The basic rule
    is that the value of a parameter will be determined by whichever control system
    last wrote to that parameter. Both EPICS and WinView will correctly display the
    current value of a parameter no matter how it was last changed. However, in WinView
    this requires closing and re-opening the window that controls that parameter, such
    as the Experiment Setup tabbed windows, to see any changes made by EPICS since the
    window was opened.
  </p>
  <p>
    This driver inherits from <a href="areaDetectorDoc.html#ADDriver">ADDriver</a>.
    It implements many of the parameters <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/asyn_n_d_array_driver_8h.html">
      asynNDArrayDriver.h</a> and in <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/_a_d_driver_8h.html">
        ADArrayDriver.h</a>. It also implements a number of parameters that are specific
    to the Roper detectors.The <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/classroper.html">roper
      class documentation</a> describes this class in detail.</p>
  <h2 id="StandardNotes" style="text-align: left">
    Implementation of standard driver parameters</h2>
  <p>
    The following table describes how the Roper driver implements some of the standard
    driver parameters. Note that there are 3 possible levels of nested acquisition looping
    when using the Roper driver. From the innermost to outermost loop these are as follows:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>ADNumExposures ($(P)$(R)NumExposures). This controls the number of exposures per
      image. This is called "accumulations" in Roper's terminology.</li>
    <li>ADNumImages ($(P)$(R)NumImages). This controls the number of images per acquisition.
      This is also called "number of images" in Roper's terminology. These images will
      all be acquired into a single 3-D array, and saved to a single SPE file in WinView.</li>
    <li>RoperNumAcquisitions ($(P)$(R)NumNumAcquisitions). This controls the number of
      times that the driver will repeat an acquisition sequence. This is has no equivalent
      in WinView, it is handled entirely by the areaDetector driver. It can be used to
      acquire multiple data sets, where each is controlled by the above parameters.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Normal: This is the same as pressing the Acquire button in WinView. It may collect
              more than 1 exposure per image if NumExposures>1, more than 1 image per acquisition
              if NumImages>1, and more than 1 aquisition if NumAcquisitions>1.</li>

              it acts as if NumAcquisitions is infinite.</li>
            <li>Focus: This is the same as pressing the Focus button in WinView. It causes acquisition
              to proceed as quickly as possible. It does not save the data. It currently does
              not call the callbacks for each frame, so the images can only be seen in WinView
              and not in EPICS. This may be fixed in a future release. </li>

    Performance measurements</h2>
  <p>
    The following measurements were done to demonstrate the performance that can be
    obtained with the areaDetector Roper driver. These measurements were made with a
    CoolSnap-HQ2 detector which has 1392x1040 pixels. The acquisition time was 0.01
    second. The overhead per image in the table below is the total time to acquire the
    data set minus 1.00 seconds (the acquisition time) divided by 100. Acquisitions
    were done in 2 modes:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>In the first mode NumImages=100 and NumAcquisitions=1, i.e. the data were all
      collected into a single SPE file. In this mode the time per image is really controlled
      by the acquisition time and readout time. At the end of the acquisition there is
      then a delay, perhaps in copying the data from one buffer to another. The acquisition
      time in this mode is the time from when acquire was started until WinView reported
      acquisition was complete and the write to disk began. The additional time to write
      the file to disk is also listed.</li>
    <li>In the second mode NumImages=1 and NumAcquisitions=100, i.e. the data were collected
      into 100 SPE files. This is equivalent to pressing the Acquire button in WinView
      100 times. There is additional overhead per image that arises from downloading parameters
      to the camera and in creating a new display window in WinView. In this mode the
      test was done both with the EPICS AutoSave PV set to 1 (which effectively does a
      WinView "Save As" operation for each file), and with AutoSave set to 0, which does
      not write disk files at all. The acquisition time listed is with AutoSave on, i.e.
      saving 100 disk files. Interestingly it was generally <i>faster</i> to collect the
      data with AutoSave on than with it off! The time to save the 100 disk files is thus
      actually negative, i.e. it took that much longer to collect the data sets <i>without</i>
      saving the disk files. The reason for this is unclear, but it seems to be something
      internal to WinView.</li>

  <h2 id="Restrictions">
    Restrictions</h2>
  <p>
    The following are some current restrictions of the Roper driver:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The are hundreds of parameters that can be controlled in WinView via the COM interface
      for acquiring, processing and displaying images. This driver does not attempt to
      support all of them, just the ones that are most commonly needed for EPICS data
      acquisition and control software. Additional features of WinView are very easy to
      add to the EPICS interface if needed in the future. Settings that EPICS does not
      control and which do not need to be frequently changed can simply be set via the
      WinView GUI.</li>
    <li>When NumImages is greater than one WinView collects a 3-D stack of images. The
      areaDetector driver can save that data to a file using WinView. However, the driver
      callbacks to plugins currently only passes the first image in that stack. It is
      not practical to pass all the images in the stack at once as a 3-d array, because
      this would require allocating a second 3-D array of the same size as the one in
      the WinView buffer. What would be possible is to pass each of the images in the
      stack on after the other. This will be implemented in a future release.</li>
    <li>Reading data files back into WinView is not currently supported. This may be added
      in a future release.</li>
    <li>The values of ADNumImagesCounter ($(P)$(R)NumImagesCounter_RBV) and ADNumExposuresCounter
      ($(P)$(R)NumExposuresCounter_RBV) are not updated during acquisition. This is because
      WinView does not appear to be correctly returning the values of the EXP_CSEQUENTS
      and EXP_CACCUMS parameters. The reason for this is under investigation and hopefully
      will be fixed in a future release.</li>
    <li>The driver does not pass callbacks for images in WinView focus mode. I don't currently
      have the required information on how to know when new data is available in focus
      mode and how to read it. Hopefully this will be added in a future release.</li>
    <li>WinView/WinSpec must be version 2.5.22 or later, because the class names changed
      in that release.</li>
    <li>The following items are hardcoded in the driver. They can be changed by recompiling
      if necessary.
      <ul>
        <li>ERROR_MESSAGE_SIZE=256 The maximum size of error messages that can be retrieved
          from WinView.</li>
        <li>ROPER_POLL_TIME=0.01 seconds. The time between polling WinView status to see when
          acquisition is complete.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>There is a bug in Windows XP SP2 that causes WinView to hang after about 1600
      acquisitions have been performed in a single WinView session. Acquisition means
      the equivalent of pressing the Acquire button, regardless of how many images were
      collected in a single acquisition. This would typically mean that 1600 SPE files
      had been saved. After 1600 acquisitions it is necessary to exit WinView and restart
      it. This problem is fixed in SP3 for Windows XP, and in Microsoft Vista.</li>
  </ul>
