    Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This is an <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics">EPICS</a> <a href="areaDetector.html">
      areaDetector</a> driver for the Pilatus pixel array detectors from <a href="http://www.dectris.com">
        Dectris</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The interface to the detector is via a TCP/IP socket interface to the <b>camserver</b>
    server that Dectris provides. The camserver program must be started before the areaDetector
    software is started, typically by running the <b>camonly</b> script provided by
    Dectris.
  </p>
  <p>
    The camserver program saves the data to disk as TIFF or CBF files. The areaDetector
    software reads these disk files in order to read the data, because camserver does
    not provide another mechanism to access the data.
  </p>
  <p>
    This driver inherits from <a href="areaDetectorDoc.html#ADDriver">ADDriver</a>.
    It implements many of the parameters in <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/asyn_n_d_array_driver_8h.html">
      asynNDArrayDriver.h</a> and in <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/_a_d_driver_8h.html">
        ADArrayDriver.h</a>. It also implements a number of parameters that are specific
    to the Pilatus detectors.The <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/classpilatus_detector.html">
      pilatusDetector class documentation</a> describes this class in detail.</p>
  <h2 id="StandardNotes" style="text-align: left">
    Implementation of standard driver parameters</h2>
  <p>
    The following table describes how the Pilatus driver implements some of the standard
    driver parameters.

        <td>
          The driver redefines the choices for the ADTriggerMode parameter (record $(P)$(R)TriggerMode)
          from ADDriver.h. The choices for the Pilatus are:
          <ul>
            <li>Internal (external signal not used)</li>
            <li>External Enable (count while external trigger line is high, readout on high to
              low transition)</li>
            <li>External Trigger (begin acquisition sequence on high to low transition of external
              trigger line)</li>
            <li>Multiple External Trigger (high to low transition on external signal triggers
              a single acquisition for the programmed exposure time)</li>
            <li>Alignment (collect images as fast as exposure time and readout permit, images
              written to a temporary file)</li>
          </ul>
          The first 4 modes correspond directly to the camserver commands <code>Exposure</code>,
          <code>ExtEnable</code>, <code>ExtTrigger</code>, and <code>ExtMTrigger</code> respectively.
          Alignment mode uses the <code>Exposure</code> command as well, but continuously
          takes images into the same temporary file (<code>alignment.tif</code>).</td>

          how long the acquisition will take. Hardware timeouts will occur if the actual time

          sets the record to 0 when acquisition is complete. This means an entire acquisition
          series if NImages &gt;1. Setting this to 0 aborts an acquisition. If the driver
          was currently acquiring imges then this record will cause the "Stop" and "K" (Kill)
          commands to be sent to camserver.</td>

          for the areaDetector driver, which is normally running in an EPICS IOC. If camserver
          and the EPICS IOC are not running on the same machine then soft links will typically
          be used to make the paths look identical.</td>

          NDFileTemplate</td>
        <td>
          $(P)$(R)FileTemplate</td>
        <td>
          camserver uses the file extension to determine what format to save the files in.
          The areaDetector Pilatus driver only supports TIFF and CBF files, so the extension
          should be .tif or .cbf. When saving multiple images (NImages>1) camserver has its
          own rules for creating the names of the individual files. The rules are as follows.
          The name constructed using the algorithm described for NDFileTemplate under <a href="areaDetectorDoc.html#asynNDArrayDriver">
            File Saving Parameters</a> is used as a basename. The following examples show
          the interpretation of the basename.
          <pre>Basename            Files produced
     
test6.tif           test6_00000.tif,  test6_00001.tif, ...
test6_.tif          test6_00000.tif,  test6_00001.tif, ...
test6_000.tif       test6_000.tif,    test6_001.tif, ...
test6_014.tif       test6_014.tif,    test6_015.tif, ...
test6_0008.tif      test6_0008.tif,   test6_0009.tif, ...
test6_2_0035.tif    test6_2_0035.tif, test6_2_0036.tif, ...
      </pre>
          The numbers following the last '_' are taken as a format template, and as a start
          value. The minimum format is 3; there is no maximum; the default is 5. The format
          is also constrained by the requested number of images.</td>

    It is useful to load and enable an NDPluginStats plugin that gets its data from
    the Pilatus driver. The MaxValue_RBV PV for that plugin can be monitored to make
    sure that the 20-bit limit of 1,048,575 is not being approached in any pixel.

    Pilatus specific parameters</h2>
  <p>
    The Pilatus driver implements the following parameters in addition to those in asynNDArrayDriver.h
    and ADDriver.h:. Note that to reduce the width of this table the parameter index
    variable names have been split into 2 lines, but these are just a single name, for
    example <code>PilatusDelayTime</code>.

          Name of a file to be used to replace bad pixels. If this record does not point to
          a valid bad pixel file then no bad pixel mapping is performed. The bad pixel map
          is used before making the NDArray callbacks. It does not modify the data in the
          files that camserver writes. This is a simple ASCII file with the following format:
          <pre>badX1,badY1 replacementX1,replacementY1 
badX2,badY2 replacementX2,replacementY2
...
          </pre>
          The X and Y coordinates range from 0 to NXPixels-1 and NYPixels-1. Up to 100 bad
          pixels can be defined. The bad pixel mapping simply replaces the bad pixels with
          another pixel's value. It does not do any averaging. It is felt that this is sufficient
          for the purpose for which this driver was written, namely fast on-line viewing of
          ROIs and image data. More sophisticated algorithms can be used for offline analysis
          of the image files themselves. The following is an example bad pixel file for a

    The following show the MEDM screens that are used to control the Pilatus detector.
    Note that the general purpose screen ADBase.adl can be used, but it exposes many
    controls that are not applicable to the Pilatus.</p>
  <p>
    <code>pilatusDetector.adl</code> is the main screen used to control the Pilatus
    driver.

  <p>
    <code>NDROI4.adl</code> is used to define the ROIs. In this example there are 3
    valid ROIs defined. ROI 1 is the entire detector, ROI 2 is a 300x50 rectangle starting
    at [100,60], and ROI 3 is a 50x30 rectangle starting at [220,70].</p>

    <code>mca.adl or mca_small.adl</code> can be used to plot the net or total counts
    in an ROI when NImages>1. In this example the plot is the net counts in ROI 1 as
    the diffractometer chi was scanned +- 1 degree with 1000 points at .02 seconds/point.
    This was done with the SPEC command
  </p>
  <pre>lup chi -1 1 1000 .02
</pre>
  <p>
    using trajectory scanning on a Newport kappa diffractometer. This was a compound
    motor scan with the Newport XPS putting out pulses every .02 seconds. These pulses
    triggered the Pilatus in External Enable mode. The Pilatus driver read each TIFF
    file as it was created and updated this plot every 0.2 seconds. The total time to
    collect this scan with 1000 images was 20.8 seconds.</p>

    <code>scan_more.adl</code> is used to define a scan. In this example the sscan record
    is set up to scan the ThresholdEnergy PV and to collect the total counts in ROI2,

    <code>scanDetPlot.adl</code> is used to plot the results of a scan after it is complete.
    In this example the total counts in ROI 1 are plotted as a function of the ThresholdEnergy
    as it was scanned from 3000 to 10000 eV in 250 eV steps. The source was Fe55, and
    the cut-off is at 6 keV, as expected for the Mn Ka and Mn Kb x-rays that this source
    produces.</p>

    At the GSECARS beamlines (13-ID-C and 13-BM-C) at the APS we use SPEC to control
    our Newport diffractometers. We have added and modified SPEC macros to use the pilatusDetector
    areaDetector driver to treat the Pilatus detector as a SPEC counter. This works
    in both traditional step-scanning mode, as well as in <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/trajectoryScan.html">
      trajectory scanning</a> mode. Here are some snippets from the SPEC macros for
    the Pilatus. We can supply the source files on request.</p>

    Performance measurements</h2>
  <p>
    The following measurements were done to demonstrate the performance that can be
    obtained with the areaDetector Pilatus driver.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>AcquireMode=Internal, NumImages=1000, AcquireTime=.005, AcquirePeriod=.01, NumExposures=1.
      The time to collect this series should be exactly 10.0 seconds. The actual time
      was measured using the EPICS camonitor program. It printed the time when acquisition
      was started (Acquire changed to Acquire=1) and when acquisition was complete (Acquire
      changed to Done=0). The time was 10.022 seconds. This includes the time for camserver
      to save all 1000 images to disk (366 MB), and for the driver to read each file,
      correct the bad pixels and flat field, compute the ROIs, and post the ROIs to EPICS.
      It also posted all of the images to EPICS. The total additional time was less than
      0.03 seconds for all 1000 images.</li>
    <li>AcquireMode=Internal, NImages=1, ExposureTime=.01, NExposures=1. An EPICS sscan
      record was used to collect 1000 points. There were no positioner PVs (to eliminate
      motor overhead). The only detector trigger was the Pilatus Acquire PV. The only
      detector PV was ROI1:0:Total_RBV. In this mode camserver is being told to individually
      collect each file. If there were no overhead then time to collect this series should
      be exactly 10.0 seconds. The actual time measured using the EPICS camonitor program
      was 45.514 seconds. The overhead is thus 35.514 seconds, or 35 ms per point. In
      this single-frame mode the driver is thus able to collect >20 images/second. For
      comparison, another measurement was done using the same EPICS sscan record, but
      using a Joerger VSC16 scaler as the detector trigger and detector. The preset time
      was also .01 seconds. The elapsed time for a 1000 point scan was 16.068 seconds,
      so the overhead was 6.068 seconds, or 6 ms per point.</li>
    <li>AcquireMode=Ext. Enable, NImages=1000, NExposures=1. SPEC was used to collect
      1000 points using <a href="http://cars.uchicago.edu/software/epics/trajectoryScan.html">
        trajectory scanning</a> mode with the Newport XPS motor controller. The following
      SPEC command was used:
      <pre>      lup chi -1 1 1000 .02
      </pre>
      This tells SPEC to do a relative scan of the chi axis from -2 degrees to +2 degrees
      with 1000 points at .015 seconds/point. On our kappa diffractometer this entails
      a coordinated motion of the phi, kappa and omega axes. The EPICS trajectory scanning
      software downloads the non-linear trajectory that SPEC computes into the XPS controller,
      which executes it. As the motors are moving the XPS outputs synchronization pulses
      at the period of the collection time, .020 seconds in this case. These pulses are
      used as the external trigger to the Pilatus. The time to execute this scan should
      be 20.0 seconds. The actual time was 20.8 seconds, measured using camonitor on the
      Acquire PV. Again, this includes the time for camserver to save all 1000 images
      to disk (366 MB), and for the Pilatus driver to read each file, correct the bad
      pixels and flat field, compute the ROIs, and post the ROIs to EPICS. It also posted
      all of the images to EPICS. The total additional time was less than 0.8 seconds
      for all 1000 images. As soon as the acquisition was complete SPEC plotted the net
      counts in the first ROI (containing the Bragg peak) as follows:
      <div style="text-align: center">
        <h3>
          1000 point SPEC scan with 20 ms per point collected in 20.8 seconds</h3>
        <img alt="pilatusSPEC.png" src="pilatusSPEC.png" /></div>
      <p>
      </p>
      For comparison this identical scan was executed in traditional step-scanning mode,
      where the motors stopped at each point in the scan. The Pilatus was run in Internal
      mode with NumImages=1. The total time for the scan was 870 seconds (more than 14
      minutes), compared to 20.8 seconds in trajectory mode. Most of this overhead is
      the settling time for the motors, with only a small fraction due to the Pilatus
      single-exposure mode. The trajectory scanning mode is thus more than 50 times faster
      to execute the identical SPEC scan.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="Hardware_notes">
    Hardware notes</h2>
  <h3>
    Trigger pulses</h3>
  <p>
    The Pilatus supports 3 types of external triggering. In External Trigger mode (the
    camserver ExtTrigger command) the Pilatus uses the programmed values of AcquireTime,
    AcquirePeriod, NImages and NExposures. It waits for a single external trigger, then
    waits for Delay seconds and then collects the entire sequence. It is very similar
    to Internal mode with NImages>1, except that it waits for a trigger to begin collecting
    the sequence.</p>
  <p>
    In External Enable mode (the camserver ExtEnable command) the Pilatus uses the external
    signal to control acquisition. Only NImages and NExposures are used, AcquireTime
    and AcquirePeriod are not used. When the signal is high the detector counts, and
    on the transition to low it begins its readout.</p>
  <p>
    In External MultiTrigger Mode (the camserver ExtMTrigger command) the Pilatus uses
    the programmed AcquireTime, in addition to NImages and NExposures. Each external
    trigger pulse causes the Pilatus to collect one image at the programmed exposure
    time. This mode works well with a trigger source like the Newport motor controllers
    or the SIS380x multichannel scaler, that put out a short trigger pulse for each
    image. One only needs to take care that the time between external trigger pulses
    is at least 4msec longer than the programmed exposure time, to allow time for the
    detector to read out before the next trigger pulse arrives.</p>
  <p>
    When using the External Enable mode, we use an inexpensive analog pulse generator
    to convert the trigger pulses from the MM4005 and XPS to a form suitable for External
    Enable mode with the Pilatus. This is the solution we have developed that seems
    to be reliable:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The synchonization pulses from the Newport MM4005 or XPS controller are input
      into the external next pulse (channel advance, control signal 1) input of the SIS3801
      multiscaler. This is the normal configuration used for MCS counting without the
      Pilatus in trajectory scanning mode.</li>
    <li>The Copy In Progress (CIP) output of the SIS3801 (control signal 5) is connected
      to the Trigger Input of a Tenma TGP110 10 MHz Pulse Generator. CIP will output a
      pulse whenever the SIS3801 does a channel advance, either in external mode with
      the motor controller pulse input, or in internal timed channel advance mode. The
      TGP100 Pulse Generator is configured as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>Trigger Input connected to CIP output of SIS3801.</li>
        <li>Triggered mode.</li>
        <li>Complement output.</li>
        <li>Pulse duration set with knobs to 3msec.</li>
        <li>TTL Output connected to the External Input of the Pilatus.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>With this configuration the SIS3801 CIP output is normally at 5V, and outputs
      a 0V pulse 1 microsecond long. The trailing (rising) edge of that pulse triggers
      the TGP110. The TGP110 TTL output is also normally at 5V, and outputs a 0V pulse
      3 milliseconds long each time the SIS3801 pulses. That output is connected to the
      Pilatus External Input. In External Enable mode when Pilatus External Input is high
      the Pilatus is counting. When the External Input is low the Pilatus reads out. The
      readout time is set via the knobs on the pulse generator to be 3 ms, which is close
      to the minimum time allowed on the Pilatus.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The Tenma TGP110 seems to be currently called a Tenma 72-6860, and lists for about
    $350 new at <a href="http://www.newark.com">Newark</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Detector Voltage</h3>
  <p>
    When we were initially testing the Pilatus in the lab, we had many errors in External
    Enable mode, where it did not seem to be seeing the external pulses. camserver would
    get DMA timeouts, and need to be restarted. Dectris said these were happening because
    the cables on our detector are longer than normal, and the voltage drop from the
    power supply to the detector was leading to marginal voltage values. They suggested
    shortening the cables or increasing the supply voltage slightly. When moving the
    detector to the hutch these problems initially went away. However, they then recurred,
    and we fixed the problem by increasing the power supply voltage from 4.4 to 4.7
    volts at the detector.</p>
  <p>
    Dectris has since informed me that they have increased the power supply voltage
    on all new Pilatus systems, so this should no longer be an issue.</p>
  <h2 id="Restrictions">
    Restrictions</h2>
  <p>
    The following are some current restrictions of the areaDetector Pilatus driver:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Limited to TIFF or CBF file format. camserver can save files in other formats,
      but the driver can currently only read TIFF and CBF files. It uses the standard
      libtiff library to read the TIFF files, so it should work on big or little endian
      machines, and should work with uncompressed or compressed files. It has only been
      tested with uncompressed files on a little-endian machine. It uses the CBFlib library
      to read the CBF files.</li>
    <li>The EPICS IOC should be run on the same computer as camserver. This is not strictly
      necessary, and places a small additional load on the CPU and network on that computer.
      However, we have found that TIFF files are available to be read within 10ms after
      camserver says they have been written if the IOC is running on the same machine
      as camserver. This is true even if the files are being saved on a remote NFS or
      SMB file system. On the other hand, if the IOC and camserver are running on separate
      machines, then the filesystem can wait up to 1 second after camserver says the TIFF
      file has been written before the IOC can read it. This is true even if the files
      are being written to the computer that the IOC is running on! This 1 second delay
      is often unacceptable for fast single-exposure scans, i.e. with NImages=1.</li>
    <li>The Pilatus driver keeps retrying to read each image file until the modification
      date of the image file is <i>after</i> the time that the acquisition was started.
      If it did not do this check then it could be reading and displaying old files that
      happen to have the same name as the current files being collected. This check requires
      that the computer that is running the soft IOC must have its clock well synchronized
      with the clock on the computer on which the files are being written (i.e. the computer
      generating the file modification time). If the clocks are not synchronized then
      the files may appear to be stale when they are not, and the driver will time out.
      The driver actually tolerates up to 10 second clock skew betweeen the computers
      but any more than this may lead to problems.</li>
    <li>Setting Acquire to 0 does not always stop acquisition immediately because camserver
      does not reliably implement the "K" command to stop an exposure sequence. In particular
      with NumImages>1 camserver seems to often ignore the K command completely, even
      with exposure times/periods as long as 10 seconds. With NumImages=1 it does kill
      the exposure after a few seconds.</li>
    <li>The following items are hardcoded in the driver. They can be changed by compiling
      if necessary.
      <ul>
        <li>MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE=256 The maximum size of message to/from camserver.</li>
        <li>MAX_FILENAME_LEN=256 The maximum size of a complete file name including path and
          extension.</li>
        <li>FILE_READ_DELAY=.01 seconds. The time between polling to see if the image file
          exists or if it is the expected size.</li>
        <li>MAX_BAD_PIXELS=100 The maximum number of bad pixels.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
