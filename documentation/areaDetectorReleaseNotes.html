    areaDetector Release Notes</h1>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 1-9-1 (11-March-2013)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>R1-9 does not work with detectors that use TCP socket servers (Pilatus, marCCD,
      mar345, PSL, and Bruker) because drvAsynIPPort.dbd was not being included.</li>
    <li>marCCD: Fixed mutex bug introduced in R1-9.</li>
    <li>commonDriverPlugins.cmd: Added loading yySseq.db for string sequence record. This
      allows creation of simple acquisition sequences, for example:
      <ol>
        <li>Close shutter, wait 0.1 seconds</li>
        <li>Take image (dark current), wait for acquisition to complete</li>
        <li>Open shutter, wait 0.1 seconds</li>
        <li>Take image</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Pilatus driver:
      <ul>
        <li>Added new HeaderString record which writes a string in the comments of a CBF file.
          Thanks to Richard Fearn from DLS for this.</li>
        <li>Added documentation for the CbfTemplateFile record which was added in R1-8.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 1-9 (27-February-2013)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>NDArray
      <ul>
        <li>Changed some variables that were previously <code>int</code> to <code>size_t</code>.
          This allows areaDetector to handle arrays with more elements than an <code>int</code>
          can represent. This is not backwards compatible with some drivers and plugins, because
          for example, the <code>dims[]</code> argument to <code>NDArrayPool->alloc()</code>
          has been changed from <code>int</code> to <code>size_t</code>. All drivers and plugins
          in areaDetector have been modified to reflect this change, but user-written drivers
          and plugins may need some minor modifications.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Drivers
      <ul>
        <li>New Andor3 driver for sCMOS (e.g. Neo and Zyla) cameras from Andor. This uses
          Version 3 of the Andor Software Development Kit (SDK). Orginal version was written
          by Phillip Sorensen from Cornell University. It runs on 32-bit and 64-bit Linux
          and 32-bit and 64-bit Windows.</li>
        <li>Bruker, Pilatus, marCCD, and mar345 drivers. The driver lock was not being taken
          in a few places when the parameter library was being accessed. This could lead to
          crashes.</li>
        <li>Prosilica driver. Thanks to Jason Abernathy from University of Victoria for these
          enhancements.
          <ul>
            <li>Implemented connection management. Cameras no longer need to be accessible when
              the IOC starts up, and can be power-cycled or disconnected and reconnected from
              the Ethernet without restarting the IOC. If the camera is not accessible when the
              IOC boots, or is power-cycled then the EPICS output records may not match the actual
              camera settings and readbacks. They can be made to agree by processing the output
              record, e.g. by pressing Enter or Return in the medm output widget.</li>
            <li>Added new record PSTimestampType which contains the type of time stamp in the
              NDArrays. Choices are "NativeTicks", "NativeSeconds","POSIX", and "EPICS". Previously
              the time stamp was always "NativeTicks".</li>
            <li>Added new record PSResetTimer which resets the time offset for time stamps.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Plugins
      <ul>
        <li>NDPluginDriver:
          <ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug that could result in plugins being registered for callbacks multiple
              times.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug that could result in plugins not running when they should if MinCallbackTime
              was 0 and the time between callbacks was less than one system clock tick.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug that could result in plugins not being registered for callbacks when
              setting EnableCallbacks=1. This problem was restricted to the case where the port
              and address were not being autoconnected, because no EPICS records were connected
              to that port and address. Removed incorrect code that was using exceptionDisconnect
              and exceptionConnect when connecting a plugin to a port and address.</li>
            <li>Changed the names of the plugin threads from "NDPluginTask" to portName+"_Plugin"
              to make them more meaningful.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>NDPluginStats: Changes to allow centroid and profile calculations for 1-D arrays.</li>
        <li>NDPluginROI: Added new parameters AutoSize[X,Y,Z]. If these are true then the
          size of the ROI in that dimension is automatically set to be the size of the input
          array minus the Min[X,Y,Z] value. This allows the ROI plugin to be used for binning
          or reversing in that dimension without having to change the ROI Size[X,Y,Z] when
          the input array size changes.</li>
        <li>NDFileNexus: Changed the version of the Nexus SDK being used from 4-2-1 to version
          4-3-0. Modified the files in this distribution to eliminate all compiler warnings
          on Windows, Linux, and Darwin. Sent these changes back to the Nexus developers,
          so hopefully they will be in the next Nexus release as well.</li>
        <li>NDFileNetCDF:
          <ul>
            <li>Fixed bug that caused invalid files to be written on big-endian machines, e.g.
              vxWorks.</li>
            <li>Increased default stack size from epicsThreadStackMedium to epicsThreadStackBig
              because netCDF needs a relatively large stack and it was crashing on vxWorks.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>NDFileDummy: Added NDFileHDF5Register and NDFileNullRegister, needed for running
          areaDetector on vxWorks.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>ImageJ Viewer
      <ul>
        <li>Upgraded CAJ from 1.1.5 to 1.1.10, and JCA from 2.3.2 to 2.3.6. This fixes a problem
          on some platforms (e.g. Windows 7 64-bit) where the display viewer would occasionally
          stop receiving CA monitor callbacks, and so the display would freeze until the PVs
          were disconnected and reconnected.</li>
        <li>The previous version of CAJ did not require setting EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES,
          because it would increase the receive buffer size to whatever was required. This
          is no longer true, so EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES must be set to at least the size
          of the largest array to be displayed.</li>
        <li>The previous version of CAJ required setting the EPICS Channel Access parameters
          in a JCALibrary.properties file. The parameters could not be set from the normal
          environment variables (e.g. EPICS_CA_MAX_ARRAY_BYTES, EPICS_CA_ADDR_LIST, etc.)
          used by the IOC and C language clients. The new versions of CAJ and JCA now support
          a Java system property called "jca.use_env". If this is set to "true" then it enables
          the use of the normal EPICS environment variables. This is very convenient, since
          there is now a single place to set the CA parameters for IOCs, C clients, and Java
          clients. </li>
        <li>EPICS_AD_Display now sets "jca.use_env=true" before it initializes CAJ, enabling
          the use of the normal EPICS environment variables.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Build system
      <ul>
        <li>Changed the build system so that the use of GraphicsMagick is optional. If the
          RELEASE file defines USE_GRAPHICSMAGICK=YES then the URL driver and the NDFileMagick
          plugin will be built. This makes it easy to build without GraphicsMagick, which
          can be necessary when using compiler versions which are incompatible with the GraphicsMagick
          libraries included with areaDetector.</li>
        <li>On Windows the TIFF and JPEG support comes from GraphicsMagick DLLs if USE_GRAPHICSMAGICK=YES.
          To enable the use of TIFF and JPEG when GraphicsMagick is not being used the TIFF
          and JPEG libraries are now also built from source code in the ADApp/tiffSupport
          directory on Windows. Which version of the TIFF and JPEG library to link with is
          chosen in commonDriverMakefile based on the value of USE_GRAPHICSMAGICK.</li>
        <li>Fixes to allow building on Darwin. Thanks to Lewis Muir for these.</li>
        <li>Many minor changes to avoid compiler warnings on Linux, Windows, and Darwin. The
          only remaining compiler warnings come from imported packages, such as netCDF.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

    Release 1-8 (6-October-2012)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Base classes
      <ul>
        <li>ADDriver
          <ul>
            <li>Added new parameter ADTemperatureActual and new record TemperatureActual, so that
              the setpoint temperature and actual temperature are now separate parameters. </li>
            <li>Added 3 new values to the ADStatus_t enum: ADStatusInitializing, ADStatusDisconnected,
              and ADStatusAborted.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>NDArray
          <ul>
            <li>The documented behavior of the maxBuffers and maxMemory arguments to the constructor
              has been changed. Previously the value -1 was documented to indicate "unlimited".</li>
            <li>However, these arguments have type size_t, so -1 is actually not a valid value,
              and in fact "unlimited" was being used if the value was &lt; 1. The new documented
              behavior is that 0 should be used to indicate "unlimited".</li>
            <li>Startup scripts should be modified to reflect this change, but old startup scripts
              using -1 will continue to work. Example startup scripts have all been corrected.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>asynNDArrayDriver
          <ul>
            <li>Added new parameters: NDPoolMaxMemory, NDPoolUsedMemory, NDPoolMaxBuffers, NDPoolAllocBuffers,
              NDPoolFreeBuffers) to monitor memory and buffer usage. Thanks to Ulrik Pedersen
              for this addition.</li>
            <li>Always create an NDArrayPool. Previously it did not create an NDArrayPool if maxMemory
              and maxBuffers were both 0. 0 now means unlimited, so we need to create always.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Drivers
      <ul>
        <li>New Andor driver. Orginal version by Matt Pearson from Diamond Light Source. This
          driver supports both USB and PCI cameras from Andor. It runs on 32-bit and 64-bit
          Linux and 32-bit and 64-bit Windows. This driver only supports the Andor CCD cameras,
          not the new Neo and Zyla sCMOS cameras. The sCMOS cameras use a new SDK library,
          and will be supported in the next release.</li>
        <li>Perkin Elmer driver. Many new features:
          <ul>
            <li>Added support for detectors with Gigabit Ethernet interfaces (e.g. model 0822).</li>
            <li>Added support for 64-bit Windows.</li>
            <li>Added support for binning. The allowed binning modes (X,Y) are (1,1), (2,2), (4,4),
              (1,2), and (1,4).</li>
            <li>Added shutter control for EPICS shutter. Shutter opens and closes automatically
              when collecting gain images or normal images, and always closes before collecting
              offset images.</li>
            <li>Added new records (PECurrentOffsetFrame, PECurrentGainFrame) to provide operator
              feedback when acquiring offset and gain images. The PEAcquireOffset and PEAcquireGain
              records have been changed to "busy" records so that clients can use ca_put_callback
              to wait for the operation to complete.</li>
            <li>Added an additional ImageMode="Average". In this mode NumImages frames are averaged
              in the Perkin Elmer driver. This is useful for long acquisition times, because the
              maximum acquisition time that the hardware supports in Internal trigger mode is
              5 seconds. NOTE: There is a bug in the current Perkin Elmer SDK library which causes
              a memory leak if the number of frames to average is 2^N (2,4,8,16, etc.) on optical
              interface frame grabbers. This problem can be worked around by average a different
              number of frames (7 rather than 8 for example). It will be fixed in the next release
              of their SDK.</li>
            <li>Removed the maxSizeX, maxSizeY, and dataType arguments from the PerkinElmerConfig()
              command. These values are now determined automatically. This means that startup
              scripts need to be modified.</li>
            <li>Improved performance of driver, eliminated unneeded copying of data, reduced lines
              of code by 10%.</li>
            <li>Demonstrated ability to stream data continuously to local disk at 15 frames/s
              at 2048x2048 (120 MB/s) and 30 frames/s at 1024x1024 (60 MB/s). These tests were
              done on a Windows 7 64-bit machine with 2 disk drives (SAS, 15K RPM, RAID 0).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>PSL driver.
          <ul>
            <li>Added support for getting images from the camera for callbacks.</li>
            <li>Changes to support new version of PSL socket server syntax.</li>
            <li>Many improvements from testing with working detector.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Pilatus driver. Thanks to Matt Pearson from Diamond Light Source for most of these
          changes.
          <ul>
            <li>Allow NumExposures &gt; 1 in all modes. It was previously limiting NumExposures
              to 1 in all modes except ExternalEnable. It is actually only very useful in ExternalEnable
              mode, but we now allow it in all modes.</li>
            <li>Fixed bug with the driver timeout when NumExposures &gt; 1. Previously the driver
              could time out before the exposure sequence was complete.</li>
            <li>Improved documentation to emphasize the importance of setting AcquireTime and
              AcquirePeriod correctly in ExternalEnable mode.</li>
            <li>New records for detector temperature and humidity, and a driver thread to poll
              these values.</li>
            <li>Read back the actual value of the threshold.</li>
            <li>Read the Tau value when setting the exposure time.</li>
            <li>New record with TVX version number, read at startup.</li>
            <li>Disabled unused records from ADBase.template.</li>
            <li>Fixed a problem reporting a read timeout error from camserver each time an image
              was acquired.</li>
            <li>Fixed a problem if the user aborted an acquisition twice in a row.</li>
            <li>Fixed thread polling for Threshold, as it wasn't working for 2M or 6M detectors.</li>
            <li>Added a 2s delay when aborting an acquisition, which seems to be needed to allow
              camserver time to clean up in some modes.</li>
            <li>Improved error reporting for multi frame acqusitions, when callbacks are turned
              off.</li>
            <li>Fixed a race condition to ensure we don't miss a stopEvent if we are doing a successful
              read from camserver.</li>
            <li>Added an automatic stop when getting a timeout from camserver, if we got no response
              (this prevents camserver and the pilatus driver getting out of sync.)</li>
            <li>Fixed race conditions that meant we occasionally read back the wrong ADStatus
              at the end of an exposure.</li>
            <li>Fixed a race condition in pilatusTask, that can cause a problem reading ADStatus
              if we sent a start and a stop in quick succession (before the pilatusTask thread
              had time to run).</li>
            <li>Added support for setting cbf_template_file.</li>
            <li>Turned off auto reconnect on the Asyn port, to force a IOC reboot if camserver
              if has been restarted.</li>
            <li>Fixed logic for setting the threshold, if we have auto apply turned off.</li>
            <li>Modified the Pilatus driver to take advantage of the new aborted state, ie. replaced
              some of the ADErrors with ADStatusAborted.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Prosilica driver. Added support for the following:
          <ul>
            <li>FrameStartTriggerDelay: Delay between trigger signal and actual frame start.</li>
            <li>FrameStartTriggerEvent: Edge or level of signal to use for trigger.</li>
            <li>FrameStartTriggerOverlap: Trigger handling when the previous frame is incomplete.</li>
            <li>FrameStartTriggerSoftware: Software trigger when TriggerMode=Software.</li>
            <li>PacketSize: When connecting to the camera the driver has always automatically
              found the largest packet size that the camera and IOC computer support. This new
              read-only record provides the actual packet size.</li>
            <li>Fixed bug which arose if MinX + SizeX was greater than MaxSizeX (same for Y).
              This is an invalid geometry, but their library does not return an error status,
              and silently reduces SizeX. However, it has a subtle bad side-effect; subsequent
              attempts to change the AcquireTime or AcquirePeriod do not return errors, but they
              do not take effect until the IOC is rebooted! Fixed the problem by reducing SizeX
              or SizeY if the requested region would be larger than the chip.</li>
            <li>Updated the support libraries to PvAPI V1.26. This means that Windows users should
              install V1.26 of the Sample Viewer program so that they are running a compatible
              version (V1.22) of the packet filter driver.</li>
            <li>Added the PvAPI library version to the report() function, to see what version
              of the library the driver was built with.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Firewire Windows driver. Added READOUT_TIME parameter. The sum of the AcquireTime
          plus the READOUT_TIME controls how long to wait before a frame timeout occurs. Previously
          a hardcoded value of 1.0 second was used, which was too short for some slow cameras.</li>
        <li>URL driver. Bug fix to prevent infinite loop if there is an error reading the
          image. Thanks to Wang Xiaoqiang from PSI for finding this problem.</li>
        <li>Simulation driver. Improvements in handling of ADStatus and ADStatusMessage, support
          new ADStatusAborted status.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Plugins
      <ul>
        <li>General
          <ul>
            <li>Added new records (QueueSize, QueueFree, QueueFreeLow) to monitor queue usage
              by all plugins. Thanks to Ulrik Pedersen for this addition.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Added new records (PoolMaxMem, PoolUsedMem, PoolMaxBuffers, PoolAllocBuffers,
              PoolFreeBuffers, PoolUsedBuffers) to monitor memory and buffer usage by plugins
              that produce NDArray outputs that other plugins attach to. Thanks to Ulrik Pedersen
              for this addition.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>NDPluginFile.
          <ul>
            <li>Added 2 new records, WriteStatus and WriteMessage to display status of file writing
              operations. Write status is a bi record with values "WriteOK" (0) and "WriteError"
              (1). WriteMessage is a waveform record containing a string with any error messages.
              The NDFilePlugin base class now updates these records for each file open or file
              write operation. All of the file plugin medm screens have been updated to display
              these new PVs.</li>
            <li>Fixed bugs that caused crashes if memory allocation failed in Capture Mode.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>NDFileTIFF.
          <ul>
            <li>Previously TIFF files were being written without the SampleFormat TIFF tag. This
              meant that the file did not distinguish between signed and unsigned integers, and
              floating point TIFF files were not supported. Some readers, notably the Python Imaging
              Library (PIL), do not recognize 32-bit TIFF files unless they contain the SampleFormat
              tag.</li>
            <li>Added the SampleFormat TIFF tag, and added support for 32-bit and 64-bit floating
              point arrays. The plugin can now write TIFF files with any NDArray type (Int8, UInt8,
              Int16, UInt16, Int32, UInt32, Float32, and Float64). IDL can read TIFF files with
              all of these data types. ImageJ can read all except Float64. PIL can read all except
              Int8, UInt32, and Float64.</li>
            <li>Write the timestamp of the array to a special TIFF tag. TIFF has a standard timestamp
              field, but unfortunately it has to be 20 characters in a standard date/time format
              so it cannot store time to sub-second precision, so a custom tag was necessary.
              Thanks to Tom Cobb for this.</li>
            <li>Added a NULL file name pointer check.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>NDFileHDF5.
          <ul>
            <li>The first change below is from Michael Davidsaver, the rest are from Ulrik Pedersen.</li>
            <li>Added a flag to allow building with HDF5 1.8.4 and above.</li>
            <li>Fixed segfault that could occur when trying to write a single frame with an uninitialised
              plugin.</li>
            <li>Added feature to do file flushing on every Nth frame.</li>
            <li>Added feature to write the current hostname to the metadata in the output file.</li>
            <li>Changed to not close and reopen datasets for each write as this causes a crash
              on windows-x64 platform when using caching in the hdf5 library -i.e. when chunking
              a 3D dataset in the first (frame) dimension,</li>
            <li>Various fixes to reduce buildtime errors and warnings on the 64bit windows platform.</li>
            <li>Added HDF5 library version number to the module name string.</li>
            <li>Added ability to change the chunking size for columns and captured frames in addition
              to the number of rows.</li>
            <li>Improved error handling when failing to open file, create dataset or write a frame.</li>
            <li>Added boundary alignment, boundary threshold, and setting istore_k parameter.</li>
            <li>Check for failure to create a new file.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>NDFileNexus.
          <ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug which caused the plugin to crash with the example iocSimDetector/NexusTemplate.xml
              template file. It could use a null object pointer in some circumstances.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug which cause the plugin to use stale attributes when creating files
              in Stream or Capture modes. Thanks to Kevin Peterson for this fix.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug that caused it to ignore the NDArrayPort PV, so the array source could
              not be changed from that in the startup script (i.e. change to ROI1, etc.).</li>
            <li>Increased the stack size for this plugin in iocBoot/commonPlugins.cmd, because
              it was crashing with a stack overflow on windows-x64.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>NDFileNull.
          <ul>
            <li>New file plugin which does not write anything. It is designed only delete the
              original driver file after it has been read back in using the DeleteDriverFile support.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>NDPluginProcess
          <ul>
            <li>Renamed the filter type "RecursiveSum" to "Average", which is a more accurate
              description.</li>
            <li>Added new filter type "Sum" which is a true sum of NumFilter arrays.</li>
            <li>Added new bo record, AutoResetFilter. If enabled then when NumFiltered=NumFilter
              the filter automatically resets. This can be very useful when using the Average
              or Sum filter modes. As soon as N sums or averages have been performed the filter
              resets so the next sum or average is computed.</li>
            <li>Added new bo record, FilterCallbacks with choices "Every array" and "Array N only".
              "Every array" selects the previous behavior, where the plugin does callbacks for
              every incoming array it receives. "Array N only" causes the plugin to only do callbacks
              when NumFiltered=NumFilter. This can be very useful when using the Sum or Average
              filter modes. Callbacks are then done only when N sums or averages have been performed.
              If used with AutoResetFilter then as input arrays arrive the plugin will continually
              output one summed or averaged array after every N incoming arrays.</li>
            <li>Improved the logic of the SaveBackground and SaveFlatField parameters. Previously
              they saved the <i>next</i> frame received after the Save request as the background
              or flat field. This behavior was not what was documented, expected or desired. The
              documented behaviour is to save the <i>current frame</i> when the SaveBackground
              or SaveFlatField is done, and the driver has been changed to do this.</li>
            <li>Set default values for the recursive filter coefficients in the template file
              for recursive filter with scale factors of 1.0. The previous defaults were 0.0 for
              all coefficients, which produced all zero output arrays. Selecting a predefined
              filter did not fix this problem, because that does not set the values of OScale
              and FScale.</li>
            <li>Fixed errors in the template file for the readback values of the filter coefficients.
              They had DTYP=asynInt32, corrected to asynFloat64.</li>
            <li>Added new record AutoOffsetScale. Processing this record will enable Offset and
              Scale calculations, and set the Offset=-min(input) and Scale=MaxScale/(max(input)-min(input)),
              where MaxScale is the maximum value of the output data type. The input image will
              thus be scaled to completely fill the range of the output data type. Thanks to Tom
              Cobb for this addition.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>NDPluginStats
          <ul>
            <li>New statistics added which give the X and Y pixel locations of the minimum and
              maximum values, MinX_RBV, MinY_RBV, MaxX_RBV, MaY_RBV. Note that these are only
              valid for 2-D monochromatic images. Thanks to Tom Cobb for these additions.</li>
            <li>Time-series arrays
              <ul>
                <li>Changed code so that time series are collected internally in the plugin, rather
                  than using callbacks to the fastSweep device support for the mca record. This is
                  more efficient, and eliminates the dependence of the areaDetector module on the
                  mca module. </li>
                <li>NOTE: This change is not backwards compatible. Clients that are collecting time-series
                  data with the mca record will need to be modified to use the new PVs that are now
                  provided in this plugin.</li>
                <li>Time series data is now available for all basic statistics and centroid statistics.
                  Previously it was only available for Total, Net, and Max.</li>
                <li>New PVs to control time series collection and provide status on it.</li>
                <li>New medm screen, NDTimeSeries.adl, to display time series data.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Fixed a bug that degraded driver performance in some circumstances. The plugin
              was not releasing the lock during come computationally expensive operations, which
              would cause the driver to wait when queueing the next array during a callback.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>NDPluginROI
          <ul>
            <li>Added new demonstration database, NDROI_sync.template, that synchronizes an ROI
              to be the size of the entire detector. This is useful when the detector binning
              or readout region is changed.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Support libraries. The static Linux support libraries provided in R1-7 were built
      on a Fedora Core 9 system (gcc 4.3.0) for 32-bit linux-x86, and on a Fedora Core
      14 system (gcc 4.5.1) for 64-bit linux-x86_64. Problems arose when trying to build
      with these libraries or to run the pre-built binaries on older Linux systems, e.g.
      those with gcc 4.1.2. These were fixed as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>The Prosilica libPvAPI.a file had been taken from the AVT gcc 4.3 directory. This
          was replaced with the one from the gcc 4.1 directory because the 4.3 version requires
          a newer version of GLIBCXX.</li>
        <li>The HDF5 library had been built with the default -std=c99. This caused the function
          isoc99_sscanf() to be called instead of sscanf(), and the former function does not
          exist on older Linux systems. The HDF library was rebuilt with -std=gnu89 on 32-bit
          and 64-bit Linux.</li>
        <li>libGraphicsMagic++.a on 64-bit was invoking std::_List_mode_base functions that
          do not exist in earlier versions of GLIBCXX. GraphicsMagick was rebuilt on an older
          Linux system (gcc 4.2.1) for 64-bit Linux.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>New host architectures, linux-x86-gcc43 and linxux-86_64-gcc42. Most libraries
      and binaries for the linux-86 and linux-x86_64 architectures are now built with
      gcc 4.6.3 on a 2.6.43 Linux kernel. These binaries will not run on older Linux systems
      because of incompatibilities in the GCC and C run-time libraries. Binaries built
      on older Linux architectures are now also provided. For 32-bits the architecture
      is called linux-x86-gcc43 and is built with gcc 4.3.0 on a 2.6.27 Linux kernel.
      For 64-bits the architecture is called linux-x86_64-gcc42 and is built with gcc
      4.2.1 on a 2.6.27 Linux kernel. Users with older Linux systems should be able to
      run one of these architectures. </li>
    <li>OPI files
      <ul>
        <li>New medm screen, commonPlugins.adl. This screen provides an overview of the status
          of all the common plugins, and allows one to enable/disable and change the asyn
          source port. ADPlugins.adl which is included on all the detector medm screens now
          contains an "All" button to load commonPlugins.adl.</li>
        <li>New directory, ADApp/op/opi, which contains CSS-BOY screens. Thanks to Erik Hanson
          for providing these.</li>
        <li>New directory, ADApp/op/edl, which contains EDM screens. Thanks to the folks from
          Diamond for providing these.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Miscellaneous
      <ul>
        <li>Fixes to commonDriverMakefile to build on Darwin (OS X).</li>
        <li>Removed dependence of areaDetector on the synApps mca module. The mca module was
          being used only to collect time-series data of the statistics in the NDPluginStats
          plugin. NDPluginStats has been changed to collect this time-series itself, using
          only standard waveform records with asyn device support.</li>
        <li>Fixes to build on Darwin.</li>
        <li>Increased stack size for HDF5 plugin in commonPlugins.cmd to avoid stack overflow
          on Windows.</li>
        <li>Fixed memory leak in constructor for paramAttribute. Thanks to Jason Abernathy
          from the University of Victoria for finding this.</li>
        <li>Renamed netCDFSrc/include to netCDFSrc/inc to work around a bug in make 3.82 on
          Cygwin. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 1-7 (09-August-2011)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>General
      <ul>
        <li>Added support for Mac OS X (Darwin). Thanks to Eric Norum and Lewis Muir for this.</li>
        <li>Added support for 64-bit Windows, windows-x64.</li>
        <li>Replaced FTVL=UCHAR with FTVL=CHAR in all waveform records, so they can be written
          to with dbpf from the IOC shell.</li>
        <li>Improved XML files for NDArray attributes and Nexus template files. Added a shell
          script to validate XML files. <strong>Note</strong>: the attribute values for datatype
          and dbrtype have been case-insensitive in the past. In the next release of areaDetector
          this will be changed to <strong>require</strong> uppercase for these values. The
          next release will also change the syntax of the <code>Attribute</code> element by
          moving the content of the <code>type</code> attribute to become the element name.
          For example the line:<br />
          <code>&lt;Attribute name="AcquireTime" type="EPICS_PV" source="13SIM1:cam1:AcquireTime"
            dbrtype="dbr_native" description="Camera acquire time"/&gt;</code><br />
          must be changed to<br />
          <code>&lt;EPICS_PV name="AcquireTime" source="13SIM1:cam1:AcquireTime" dbrtype="DBR_NATIVE"
            description="Camera acquire time"/&gt;</code><br />
          and<br />
          <code>&lt;Attribute name="CameraManufacturer" type="PARAM" source="MANUFACTURER" datatype="string"
            description="Camera manufacturer"/&gt;</code><br />
          must be changed to<br />
          <code>&lt;PARAM name="CameraManufacturer" source="MANUFACTURER" datatype="STRING"
            description="Camera manufacturer"/&gt;</code><br />
          This change will make it much easier to validate the XML files. Thanks to Pete Jemian
          for these changes.</li>
        <li>On Windows if NDFilePath has a trailing '\' then preserve it, else add a '/' character
          if one is not present.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Drivers
      <ul>
        <li>New URL driver which reads images from any URL, including Web cameras and Axis
          video servers. This driver uses GraphicsMagick to read the images, and can thus
          handle a large number of image formats (JPEG, TIFF, PNG, etc.).</li>
        <li>New driver for Bruker BIS (Bruker Instrument Service) detectors. There was a preliminary
          version of this driver in the apex2Src directory in R1-6. It is now fully functional.
          and should work with any BIS detector, not just the Apex2.</li>
        <li>New driver for Photonic Sciences Ltd. (PSL) detectors. This driver currently can
          do everything except read the data back from the detector. That capability needs
          to be added, which requires access to a PSL detector for development and testing.</li>
        <li>Simulation driver. Added additional simulation mode for Gaussian peaks. John Hammonds
          added this feature.</li>
        <li>Changed the setShutter() function in ADDriver.h to be a virtual function, which
          it should have been all along. The base-class implementation for an EPICS shutter
          is now used by default. Changed the drivers to use the virtual function.</li>
        <li>Initialized ADAcquire to 0 in ADDriver::ADDriver. In R1-6 ADAcquire was not initialized,
          and if it had a non-zero value at iocInit then the IOC could crash with some drivers,
          e.g. simDetector.</li>
        <li>Pilatus driver.
          <ul>
            <li>Added support for camserver saving data in the CBF file format, which is ~4X smaller
              than TIFF, and for additional header information in the files for crystallography.
              Thanks to Lewis Muir for these additions. </li>
            <li>Set FullFilename_RBV for each file in a multi-image sequence, which was not previously
              being done.</li>
            <li>Several changes from Emma Shepherd at DLS to improve error handling.</li>
            <li>Added GapFill record to control what value camserver puts in the data files in
              the gaps between modules in multi-element Pilatus detectors.</li>
            <li>Added ThresholdAutoApply and ThresholdApply records. These allow only sending
              the gain and threshold energy once to camserver, rather than each time either is
              changed. This can speed operations significantly on larger detectors. For example,
              on the 6M it takes 78 seconds for camserver to execute the SetThreshold command.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Prosilica driver.
          <ul>
            <li>Added support for opening cameras by IP address or IP DNS name, in addition to
              UniqueID. This allows communicating with cameras that are not on the local subnet.
              The change is backwards compatible with existing iocsh startup scripts.</li>
            <li>Added new records PSByteRate and PSByteRate_RBV that control and read the StreamBytesPerSecond
              parameter in the Prosilica PvAPI driver. This allows limiting the bandwidth that
              a camera uses. It also allows operation of GigE cameras on non-Gigabit Ethernet
              networks.</li>
            <li>Added new parameter, maxPvAPIFrames, to the prosilicaConfig command in the startup
              script. This parameter controls how many frame buffers are allocated in the PvAPI
              driver. This is the last parameter in the prosilicaConfig command, and if it is
              absent the default value of 2 is used, which is sufficient in most circumstances.
              However, with very high frame rates or busy IOCs increasing this value can reduce
              dropped frames. </li>
            <li>Removed support for writing TIFF files using the driver library. This was a problem
              because their driver uses an incompatible version of libtiff that conflicts with
              the new version used by GraphicsMagick. The driver TIFF writer had no advantage
              over using the NDFileTIFF and NDFileMagick plugins, which have more features and
              can run in their own threads.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug that could cause a blue-screen crash on Windows 7. The new version
              of their library requires clearing a structure to 0 before using it.</li>
            <li>Send command to stop acquistion when first connecting to a camera. This fixes
              a problem when connecting to CMOS cameras that were left in the acquiring state
              when the IOC exited.</li>
            <li>Upgraded to version 1.24 of the AVT SDK, and 1.20 of the Windows filter driver.
              Users should install the latest Sample Viewer and filter driver 1.20 on Windows
              machines so that the areaDetector application can use the filter driver. The filter
              driver version in areaDetector must match the one installed on Windows in order
              to use it.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Plugins
      <ul>
        <li>NDPluginFile: Added a new record called DeleteDriverFile. This record allows the
          file writing plugins to delete the "original" file that the driver created for that
          array. This can be useful for detectors that must write the data to disk in order
          for the areaDetector driver to read it back. Once a file-writing plugin has rewritten
          the data in another format it can be desireable to then delete the original file.
          The file is only deleted if the following are all true:
          <ol>
            <li>The DeleteDriverFile record is "Yes".</li>
            <li>The file plugin has successfully written a new file.</li>
            <li>The array contains an attribute called "DriverFileName" that contains the full
              file name of the original file. The driver attributes XML file should contain a
              line like the following:<br />
              <tt>&lt;Attribute name="DriverFileName" type="PARAM" source="FULL_FILE_NAME" datatype="string"
                description="Driver file name"/&gt;</tt><br />
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>NDPluginFile: Added support for getting the file name and file number from array
          attributes rather than from the normal EPICS PVs. Having the file information come
          from the array allows the driver to control which plugin saves a particular array.
          For example, there may be two file writing plugins active; the first saves the flat
          field files for a tomography experiment, and the second saves the normal projections,
          each streaming data to a separate file. The driver knows which files are flat fields
          and which are normal projections, and adds the appropriate attributes to control
          which plugin saves each array. Thanks to Ulrik Pedersen for this addition.</li>
        <li>NDPluginFile: Added XML Schema file (<tt>iocBoot/attributes.xsd</tt>) to allow
          syntax validation of an NDArray driver attributes XML file.</li>
        <li>New file writing plugin, NDFileHDF5. This plugin writes HDF5 files with the native
          HDF5 API, unlike the NeXus plugin which uses the NeXus API. It supports 3 types
          of compression. Thanks to Ulrik Pedersen at Diamond Light Source for providing this
          plugin.</li>
        <li>New file writing plugin, NDFileMagick. This uses GraphicsMagick to write files,
          and can write in dozens of file formats, including JPEG, TIFF, PNG, PDF, etc.</li>
        <li>Fixed problem with NDPluginTransform. It was holding the lock while it did computationally
          intensive tasks. This slowed down the driver from which the plugin was getting its
          data, because the driver was forced to wait to queue the next frame until the plugin
          was done processing. The new version behaves correctly, dropping frames when the
          plugin cannot keep up, rather than slowing down the driver.</li>
        <li>NDPluginColorConvert. Added support for false color when converting 8-bit mono
          to RGB1, RGB2, or RGB3. Thanks to Tom Cobb for this addition.</li>
        <li>NDPluginStats. Removed duplicate record for MeanValue_RBV from NDStats.template.</li>
        <li>NDFileNetCDF. Upgraded from netCDF 3.6.2 to netCDF 4.1.3. Fixed bug which was
          causing crashes when when writing files >2GB on win32-x86. netCDF files of any size
          can now be written on all platforms.</li>
        <li>NDFileNexus. This is now built from the NeXus source code on all platforms, rather
          than including prebuilt binaries in nexusSupport. Upgraded from Nexus 4.2.0 to 4.2.1,
          which fixes a stack overflow problem with the default stack size on win32-x86. Removed
          support for HDF4 and XML files, only HDF5 is now supported. Thanks to Jeff Gebhardt
          for initially doing this.</li>
        <li>NDFileNexus: Added Schematron file (<tt>iocBoot/template.sch</tt>) to allow syntax
          validation of a NeXus template XML file.</li>
        <li>NDFileNexus: Now recognizes all current NeXus base class names (was missing some
          newer base classes such as <tt>NXcollection</tt>).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Viewers
      <ul>
        <li>ImageJ EPICS_AD_Viewer. Additional sanity check in code to see if EPICS PVs are
          connected, prevent dereferencing a null pointer. Thanks to Lewis Muir for this.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Internals
      <ul>
        <li>Greatly simplified the Makefiles in each driver source directory by having them
          each include a common Makefile.</li>
        <li>Greatly simplified the dbd files in each driver source directory by having them
          each include a common dbd file.</li>
        <li>Renamed pluginSupport.dbd to NDPluginSupport.dbd, and made individual DBD files
          for each plugin to make it easy for external software to use only a subset of the
          plugins.</li>
        <li>Removed nexusSupport directory, which had previously contained prebuilt versions
          of the NeXus library, as well as prebuilt versions of the HDF5 support library.
          This was replaced with a NeXusSrc directory which builds the NeXus library from
          source code on all platforms. This is currently version NeXus 4.2.1. A new support
          directory, hdf5Support, was added which contains the header files and prebuilt libraries
          for HDF5. This is currently version 1.8.7 of HDF5.</li>
        <li>Use CYCGWIN_RPC_LIB variable when building on Cygwin to allow either Cygwin 1.5.x
          or 1.7.x.</li>
        <li>Minor changes to many drivers and plugins to allow building dynamically (DLLs)
          on WIN32.</li>
        <li>Added methods to the NDArray class to provide access to maxBuffers, numBuffers,
          etc.</li>
        <li>Removed JPEG and TIFF libraries on win32-x86, they are not needed because the
          libraries are part of GraphicsMagick.</li>
        <li>Changed Makefiles so they will work correctly with the -debug variant on the target
          archs.</li>
        <li>Install ADApp/Db/*.template files as part of build process.</li>
        <li>Changed NDArrayPool so that it will free the memory in NDArrays in the pool to
          permit allocating one with sufficient memory to satisfy an alloc() request. Thanks
          to Tim Madden for the initial version of this.</li>
      </ul>

    Release 1-6 (20-May-2010)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>General
      <ul>
        <li>Converted to be compatible with asynPortDriver in asyn R4-13, which changes parameter
          handling.</li>
        <li>Changes to support 64-bit architectures, including linux-x86_64. This also required
          changes to the synApps modules on which areaDetector applications depend (autosave,
          busy, etc.)</li>
        <li>Changes in Makefiles to support the win32-x86-debug architecture.</li>
        <li>Added status parameter to indicate if the specified file path (NDFilePath) exists.
          Added a record to NDFile.template and a status indicator to all medm file saving
          screens.</li>
        <li>Append a trailing '/' character to file path (NDFilePath) if one is not present.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Drivers
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a bug in the Roper driver. There was a buffer overflow problem in the function
          that converts C strings to Windows BSTR strings. This would cause the IOC to crash
          when saving SPE files with Comment PVs longer than 40 characters.</li>
        <li>Many fixes to Windows Firewire driver:
          <ul>
            <li>Added dropped frame counter.</li>
            <li>Fixed timeout problem with acquire times &gt; 1 second.</li>
            <li>Fixed logic when acquisition was turned off</li>
            <li>Fixed problem with constructor when it encountered a minor error; was causing
              capture thread not to be started for some cameras.</li>
            <li>Implemented AcquireTime parameter, previously the time could only be changed via
              a Firewire feature.</li>
            <li>Fixed bug when setting a feature value in non-absolute mode after it was set in
              absolute mode.</li>
            <li>Removed the ability to change video modes, formats or rates when acquiring because
              it is too complex to stop and wait for it to be done.</li>
            <li>Report details for all supported Firewire "features" in report() function, called
              by asynReport() and dbior().</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>pvCam driver. Fixed problem with exposure time being rounded to integer. Add PVs
          to provide version information for software and firmware where possible. Add PVs
          to provide serial numbers where possible. Perform checks on parameters that are
          not available for all cameras. </li>
        <li>ADSC driver. Fixed a bug where it would not correctly load the per-image parameters
          for the first image in a dataset if they were changed after the acquisition was
          started but before the first image was taken. Added ability to write simulated data
          to disk in the simulation driver.</li>
        <li>Pilatus driver. Increased the timeout for the SetThreshold command to camserver
          from 3 seconds to 90 seconds, because it takes almost this long to execute on the
          Pilatus 6M.</li>
        <li>marCCD driver. Added support for baseline stabilization, which is done with the
          "set stability" and "get stability" remote commands. Baseline stabilization is an
          extra-cost option for marCCD, so this command only has any affect if that option
          is present. But all versions of marCCD understand the command remote command syntax,
          so there is no problem if the option is not installed.<br />
          Changed the TwoTheta record from a stringout to ao, and this value is now always
          sent with the "header" remote command. This requires that the string "theta_display_name
          TwoTheta" be present in one of the marCCD configuration files that gets loaded,
          typically in goniostat_none.conf or goniostat_sw.conf.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Plugins
      <ul>
        <li>NDPluginROI. Major rewrite. Previously the ROI plugin supported multiple ROIs,
          performed statistics calculations, and highlighted the ROIs. The new version is
          much simpler; it supports only a single ROI, and does not calculate statistics or
          do highlighting. Those functions have been moved to new plugins. One new function
          has been added, the ability to divide the array by a scale factor, which is useful
          for avoiding overflow when binning. Fixed problem when a single color is extracted
          from a color image; it now removes the unused dimension and changes the colorMode
          to mono.</li>
        <li>NDPluginColorConvert. Added conversions from mono to RGB1, RGB2, and RGB3, and
          from RGB1, RGB2, and RGB3 to mono. Previously this plugin only built on Linux and
          WIN32. Now it builds and does all conversions except Bayer on all architectures.
          Bayer conversion is restricted to Linux and WIN32.</li>
        <li>Added new NDPluginStats plugin. This plugin calculates statistics on an array.
          It replaces the statistics calculations that were previously performed in the ROI
          plugin. It adds new statistics, including the centroid position and width. It also
          computes X and Y profiles, including average profiles, profiles at the centroid
          position, and profiles at a user-defined cursor position. Thanks to Stephen Mudie
          from the Australian Synchrotron, John Dobbins from Cornell, and Huijuan Xu from
          Brookhaven National Lab for the initial versions of these calculations.</li>
        <li>Added new NDPluginProcess plugin. This plugin does arithmetic processing on arrays:
          <ul>
            <li>Background subtraction.</li>
            <li>Flat field normalization.</li>
            <li>Offset and scale.</li>
            <li>Low and high clipping.</li>
            <li>Recursive filtering in the time domain.</li>
            <li>Conversion to a different output data type.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Added new NDPluginOverlay plugin. This plugin adds graphic overlays to an image.
          It replaces the "Highligh ROIs" function that was previously provided in the ROI
          plugin. But it is much more general, and can be used to display not only ROIs, but
          multiple cursors, user-defined boxes, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Example IOCs
      <ul>
        <li>Greatly simplified the st.cmd and auto_settings.req files for each IOC. This was
          done by creating two new files: iocBoot/commonPlugins.cmd and iocBoot/commonPlugin_settings.req.
          These files define a common set of plugins that are loaded for all example IOCs.
          They load all of the plugins except the NDPluginStdArrays plugin, because that plugin
          needs to have its data type and waveform size matched to the specific detector.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>medm screens
      <ul>
        <li>Created medm screen "components" which are used in actual screens via the "composite
          file" mechanism wherever possible. This simplifies the maintenance of the medm screens
          for detectors and plugins.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Viewers
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a bug in the ImageJ EPICS_AD_Viewer.java that required restarting the plugin
          if it was told to start displaying before any frames had been acquired by the IOC.</li>
        <li>Fixed bugs in the ImageJ EPICS_AD_Viewer.java that caused an exception when trying
          to deference a null window pointer. Some of these bugs only became apparent when
          running the latest version of ImageJ (1.43U) which will not work with previous releases
          of EPICS_AD_Viewer.java.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Internals
      <ul>
        <li>Added new form of NDArrayPool::convert that only changed data type, does not take
          dims argument.</li>
        <li>Added more fields to the NDArrayInfo_t structure and the NDArray::getInfo method
          to simplify handling color images.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Known problems. This release of areaDetector exposed two bugs in EPICS 3.14.11.
      Links to the required patches can be found on the <a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/base/R3-14/11-docs/KnownProblems.html">
        EPICS 3.4.11 Known Problems page</a>.
      <ul>
        <li>The epicsThreadOnceOsd problem can cause crashes with an "assert" error on IOC
          initialization on Win32 systems.</li>
        <li>The macLib problem can cause crashes or memory corruption when the commonPlugins.cmd
          script expands lines with macros longer than 256 characters.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 1-5 (23-August-2009)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>General
      <ul>
        <li>Added "attributes" to NDArray. Attributes are used to contain metadata about the
          array. Each attribute has a name, description, datatype and value. Attributes can
          be added by drivers or plugins, and travel with the array through the plugin chain,
          and can ultimately be written with the array data to a file. Attributes can come
          from driver or plugin parameters, or from EPICS PVs anywhere on the network.</li>
        <li>Separated parameters and functions which are general to NDArray data (asynNDArrayDriver
          base class) from those which are specific to areaDetector data (ADDriver base class).
          This makes it easy and clean to use asynNDArray driver for future applications beyond
          areaDetector, such as drivers for the XIA xMAP digital spectroscopy system.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Drivers
      <ul>
        <li>New driver for mar345 online image plate detector. This driver communicates via
          a TCP/IP socket with the mar345dtb program, which must be used to control the detector.</li>
        <li>New driver for Firewire IIDC/DCAM cameras under Windows. This driver uses the
          Windows 1394 camera driver from Carnegie Mellon University.</li>
        <li>New driver for the Perkin-Elmer amorphous silicon flat panel detectors. Thanks
          to Brian Tieman and John Hammonds for this driver.</li>
        <li>New driver for the Roper Scientific detectors using the PVCAM library. Thanks
          to Brian Tieman for this driver.</li>
        <li>Added support for color to the simulation detector driver. It now supports color
          modes Mono, RGB1, RGB2 and RGB3.</li>
        <li>Fixed 2 serious bugs in the Roper driver. It was not selecting ROI mode correctly.
          When NumAcquisitions was &gt; 1 it was only collecting the first frame correctly,
          subsequent frames were the same as a first one. This has been isolated to a bug
          in the WinView COM interface, and a workaround for the problem has been implemented.</li>
        <li>Solved problem of Prosilica driver crashing on Linux. The problem was with the
          SIGALARM signal handlers in EPICS base (R3.14.10 and earlier). There is a patch
          for base to fix this problem, and this fix will be included in EPICS base 3.14.11.</li>
        <li>Added an additional state, "Initializing" to DetectorState_RBV record.</li>
        <li>Added support for ADTriggerMode=External in marCCD driver. In this mode the AcquireTime
          is not used to stop acquisition; acquisition must be stopped by external software
          settings Acquire=0. The AcquireTime PV is written to the marCCD TIFF file header
          as usual. This allows an external timing control of the shutter but with the actual
          exposure time written to the header. Fixed minor problem with marCCD driver. If
          Acquire was set to Stop when it was not acquiring then the next time acquisition
          was started it would stop immediately.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Plugins
      <ul>
        <li>Changed NDPluginFile from directly supporting netCDF to be a base class from which
          actual file plugins derive.</li>
        <li>Changed netCDF file support to be derived class inheriting from NDPluginFile.
          Added support for writing NDArray attributes to the netCDF file.</li>
        <li>New file plugin for TIFF files. The TIFF support includes 8, 16 and 32-bit integers.
          It supports monochrome and color images, including all 3 color interleave modes
          (RGB1, RGB2 and RGB3. areaDetector contains all required support files to build
          and run the TIFF file plugin on win32-x86, cygwin-x86 and Linux. To build on other
          operating systems it is necessary to install the libtiff and libtiffstatic packages.
          Thanks to John Hammonds for the initial work on this plugin.</li>
        <li>New file plugin for JPEG files. The JPEG support is limited to 8-bit integers,
          but it supports monochrome and color images, including all 3 color interleave modes
          (RGB1, RGB2 and RGB3). Control is provided for the JPEG quality (compression) on
          a scale of 0 (worst) to 100 (best). areaDetector contains all required support files
          to build and run the JPEG file plugin on win32-x86, cygwin-x86, and Linux. To build
          on other operating systems it is necessary to install the libjpeg and libjpegstatic
          packages. </li>
        <li>New file plugin for NeXus HDF files written by John Hammonds. The NeXus support
          has not been extensively tested, and is currently limited to writing a single array
          per file. Support for multiple arrays per file will be added in a future release.
          areaDetector contains all required support files to build and run the NeXus file
          plugin on win32-x86, cygwin-x86 and Linux. To build on other operating systems it
          is necessary to install the Nexus, HDF4, HDF5, and MXML packages. </li>
        <li>Fixed bug in NDPluginFile: was not closing file properly when stream mode was
          stopped before the requested number of frames.</li>
        <li>Fixed logic problem with FileNumber record in NDFile.template database. The previous
          logic that kept the ao record in sync with the ai record was causing the ao record
          to process when it should not have been, causing an extra call to the driver.</li>
        <li>Added an additional record to NDPluginBase.template, PluginType_RBV. All plugins
          set this to a unique string to identify the plugin type.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>medm displays
      <ul>
        <li>Added new top-level detector-specific displays for Prosilica (prosilica.adl),
          Firewire (firewire.adl), and simDetector (simDetector.adl). ADBase.adl should no
          longer be used for these cameras.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Viewers
      <ul>
        <li>Added new ImageJ plugin viewer. This was begun by Tim Madden from APS, and now
          includes support for all NDArray data types and color modes, i.e. Mono, RGB1 (pixel
          interleave), RGB2 (row interleave) and RGB3 (plane interleave). The plugin directory
          includes a plugin written elsewhere for reading and writing netCDF files, so ImageJ
          can be used to display images and image sequences (movies) saved with the NDFileNetCDF
          plugin. It also includes a dynamic profile plugin written elsewhere for line profiles
          that update in real time as new images are displayed.</li>
        <li>Improved IDL epics_ad_display viewer. The last image is now stored in the program,
          and it is now redisplayed if the view mode is changed (TVSCL to iimage, etc.) or
          if the display parameters are changed (autoscale, flip Y, minimum, maximum, etc.).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Documentation
      <ul>
        <li>Documented the source code with comments that doxygen can process to produce HTML
          documentation directly from the source. This provides documentation for each class,
          as well as the class inheritance tree. Thanks to John Hammonds for starting this.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Internals
      <ul>
        <li>Moved the asynPortDriver base C++ class from the areaDetector module to the asyn
          module. The asynPortDriver base class was modified slightly to make it more general.
          In particular the constructor no longer hardcodes ASYN_CANBLOCK, ASYN_MULTIDEVICE,
          epicsThreadPriorityMedium, and epicsThreadStackMedium. This requires that asyn R4-11
          or later be used, and requires 2 additional arguments to the constructor (priority
          and stackSize) for all areaDetector drivers and plugins.</li>
        <li>Removed mutexId from asynPortDriver base class, and added lock() and unlock()
          methods. This hides the implementation of the locking, since we might want to implement
          these with asynManager->lockPort in the future.</li>
        <li>Removed the file ADStdParams.h. Moved the definition of parameters that are general
          to NDArray drivers into asynNDArrayDriver.h, and those that are specific to areaDetector
          drivers into ADDriver.h.</li>
        <li>Added an XML parser which is used for attribute definition files.</li>
        <li>Fixed Makefiles to instantiate templates on vxWorks.</li>
        <li>Moved createFileName() from ADDriver and NDPluginDriver to their base class, asynNDArrayDriver.</li>
        <li>Changed colorMode and bayerPattern from being properties of NDArray to being attributes,
          since they are not general to NDArray but are specific to areaDetector.</li>
        <li>Added new method asynPortDriver::drvUserCreateParam, which simplifies drvUserCreate
          code in all drivers and plugins.</li>
        <li>Reduced number of files for all plugins and drivers. Previously there was an XXX.cpp,
          drvXXX.h, and drvXXXEpics.c. The .h and .c files were used to keep the drivers and
          plugins independent of EPICS IOC code. It was decided that that extra 2 files per
          driver and plugin were not worth the added complexity. If it is desired to run drivers
          and plugins outside of an IOC it could be done with conditional compilation of the
          IOC dependent code, which is all at the end of the .cpp file. The iocsh commands
          to create plugins have been changed from drvNDxxxConfigure to NDxxxConfigure, for
          example drvNDStdArraysConfigure was changed to NDStdArraysConfigure. This requires
          changes to all st.cmd files.</li>
        <li>Renamed a few parameters and the drvInfo strings to logically separate things
          that are general to NDArrays and things that are specific to area detectors. For
          example, the drvInfo fields IMAGE_SIZE_xxx were renamed to ARRAY_SIZE_xxx, and IMAGE_COUNTER
          was renamed to ARRAY_COUNTER.</li>
        <li>Added call to epicsExit() to all driver IOC main programs. This is important for
          allowing EPICS to exit cleanly. Without this on Linux it was often necessary to
          kill the IOC with ^C, rather than just typing "exit".</li>
        <li>NDStdArrays.template had the DTYP field of the waveform record changed from asynInt$(SIZE)ArrayIn
          to asyn$(TYPE)ArrayIn. This was needed to allow it to be used with asynFloat32 and
          asynFloat64 data types. This requires a change to all iocBoot st.cmd files that
          load this template file.</li>
        <li>Plugins can now add attributes to an NDArray, which means they can modify the
          array and hence need to make a copy of it. This requires that NDArray->release()
          must be called in the plugin itself, rather than in the NDPluginDriver base class
          as was done previously.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 1-4 (30-January-2009)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added a driver for Roper Scientific (i.e. Princeton Instruments and Photometrics)
      detectors. It uses the Microsoft COM interface to control the WinView or WinSpec
      programs. The previous support in the "ccd" module used a Visual Basic socket server
      and an SNL program to accomplish this. It was hard to maintain, because Visual Basic
      changed incompatibly from one release of Visual Studio to the next, and because
      it could not be built with the EPICS build system. The new driver is written in
      C++, and is built entirely with the EPICS build system. It also supports more WinView
      features than the ccd version, and makes the detector data available via callbacks.
      This allows detector data to be displayed with EPICS clients, permits ROI or other
      plugin calculations, and allows saving in other file formats if desired. </li>
    <li>Added support for color:
      <ul>
        <li>Added NDColorMode_t and NDBayerPattern_t to NDArray.h. Added new fields colorMode
          and bayerPattern to NDArray structure to indicate the color mode.</li>
        <li>Added new parameter ADColorMode to ADStdDriverParams.h and new record ColorMode
          to ADBase.template.</li>
        <li>Added new parameter NDColorMode and NDBayerPattern to NDPluginBase.h and new records
          ColorMode and BayerPattern to NDPluginBase.template. Added these records to all
          plugin medm screens.</li>
        <li>Added a new plugin NDPluginColorConvert to convert colors. It currently converts
          Bayer to RGB1, RGB2 or RGB3, RGB1 to RGB2 or RGB3 and RGB3 to RGB1 or RGB2.</li>
        <li>The Prosilica driver now supports color. It supports RGB1 and Bayer directly,
          and RGB2 and RGB3 through the NDPluginColorConvert plugin.</li>
        <li>The NDPluginFile driver now saves the ColorMode and BayerPattern to the netCDF
          files.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Added a Viewers directory. This contains an IDL viewer for displaying images.
      The viewer supports color and several different viewing modes. It can be run for
      free under the IDL Virtual Machine, and should work on any platform with a version
      of ezcaIDL.so or ezcaIDL.dll built with EPICS 3.14. This directory also contains
      IDL class libraries for accessing areaDetector. These classes are used by the viewers,
      but can also be used for other IDL applications.</li>
    <li>Added new parameters in ADStdDriverParams.h
      <ul>
        <li>ADTemperature</li>
        <li>ADReadStatus</li>
        <li>ADImageSizeZ</li>
        <li>ADNumExposuresCounter</li>
        <li>ADColorMode</li>
        <li>ADPortNameSelf</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Pilatus driver
      <ul>
        <li>Send the imgpath command to camserver when the ADFilePath parameter is changed.
          camserver will then create directories if they do not exist, whereas specifying
          a path with non-existant directories in the "exposure" or acquire commands will
          not create directories. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Prosilica driver
      <ul>
        <li>Added support for color. </li>
        <li>Added support for the external sync in, sync out and strobe signals. The sync
          signals can also be used for general-purpose digital I/O.</li>
        <li>Made minor changes to the code and to the build system to add support for running
          the driver under Linux. There are some issues with this drivers use of SIGARLM via
          Posix Timer library and EPICS signal handlers. I have made some minor modifications
          to EPICS base 3.14.10 to allow the IOC to run. Prosilica is working on a new version
          of their driver that should fix these issues, but it is not yet working. The prebuilt
          binary version of this release of areaDetector includes the fixes to EPICS base
          and does work satisfactorily.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>NDPluginROI
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed bug with missing roi argument to setIntegerParam call, some parameters not
          updating correctly.</li>
        <li>Added maxBuffers argument to constructor and to iocsh configuration command. This
          was a serious oversight in the previous versions. maxROIs was being used where the
          missing maxBuffers parameter should have been used. Unfortunately it requires a
          new argument to the iocsh drvNDROIConfigure command, which is not backwards compatible
          with previous startup scripts.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>NDArray
      <ul>
        <li>Changed the NDArray::copy() methods to NDArrayPool::copy(). Previously the copy
          was being allocated from the NDArrayPool of the copy source, rather than from the
          caller's array pool.</li>
        <li>Added colorMode and bayerPattern fields to NDArray class.</li>
        <li>Fixed a bug in the NDArray::convertDim function that could cause an array bounds
          error if a dimension was reversed.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>asynPortDriver
      <ul>
        <li>Renamed the pasynUser member to pasynUserSelf. This avoids a name conflict with
          the local variable pasynUser used in many derived classes. Unfortunately this requires
          changes to derived class code where this-&gt;pasynUser was used.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Added simulation code to ADSC driver. This allows it to be built and tested on
      systems that do not have the ADSC hardware or software installed.</li>
    <li>Added $(P)$(R)AutoSave to the save/restore settings in NDFile_settings.req so
      it will be restored on reboot. This requires care when using drivers such as the
      Prosilica which can rapidly save very large data files, since file saving may be
      resumed on reboot. </li>
    <li>Removed abusy record, replaced with new version of busy record from new busy module.</li>
    <li>Renamed ADPlugin library to NDPlugin, because it is really N-dimensional.</li>
    <li>Renamed marCCD library to marCCD_AD, because marCCD is already used in the ccd
      module, and it conflicts. Changed marCCDSupport.dbd to marCCD_ADSupport.dbd, name
      of register command, etc.</li>
    <li>Added PortName_RBV record to ADBase.template and NDPluginBase.template and to
      all driver and plugin medm screens. This allows the user to see the asyn port name
      of the driver or plugin, which is useful when switching the NDArray callback source.</li>
    <li>Modified the detector medm screens to contain links to the plugins that are normally
      loaded for that driver, e.g. a single instance each of NDStdArrays, NDROI, NDFile
      and NDColorConvert (for detectors that support color).</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 1-3 (24-November-2008)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Added a driver for MarCCD detectors. Compared to the previous support in the "ccd"
      module, this driver uses the faster Version 1 protocol for the Mar server. It also
      makes the detector data available via callbacks (by reading the TIFF files as soon
      as they are written). This allows detector data to be displayed with EPICS clients,
      and for ROI calculations.</li>
    <li>Added support for shutter control. Supports shutters that are driven directly
      from the detector hardware, as well as shutters controlled by EPICS records. Shutter
      support is implemented for the MarCCD, Pilatus, and simulation detectors.</li>
    <li>Added new methods for shutter support to the detector base class ADDriver.cpp
      <ul>
        <li>ADDriver::setShutter()</li>
        <li>ADDriver::writeInt32</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Reorganized the file I/O parameters, template files and medm screens
      <ul>
        <li>Moved the file capture parameters from NDPluginFile.h and NDPluginFile.cpp to
          ADStdDriverParams.h. This allows a detector driver to use these capture parameters
          if desired.</li>
        <li>Removed all of the file I/O records from ADBase.template and ADBase_settings.req.
          These previously duplicated the records in NDFile.template and NDFile_settings.req,
          which was hard to maintain. IOCs for detector drivers that can do file I/O now need
          to load NDFile.template, while those that cannot no longer need to load these records.
          They also need to have NDFile_settings.req added to auto_settings.req. This does
          not effect the file plugin support, only drivers that directly do file I/O.</li>
        <li>Removed the file I/O PVs from ADBase.adl. Added a related display link to NDFile.adl.</li>
        <li>NDFile.adl now contains only the file related PVs, not the plugin related PVs.
          The new file NDPluginFile.adl replaces the previous version of NDFile.adl, and contains
          both the file PVs and the plugin PVs.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Added new enums in ADStdDriverParams.h
      <ul>
        <li>ADFrameType_t</li>
        <li>ADShutterMode_t</li>
        <li>ADFileMode_t</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Added new parameters in ADStdDriverParams.h
      <ul>
        <li>ADShutterControl (replaces ADShutter)</li>
        <li>ADShutterControlEPICS</li>
        <li>ADShutterStatus</li>
        <li>ADShutterMode</li>
        <li>ADShutterOpenDelay</li>
        <li>ADShutterCloseDelay</li>
        <li>ADTimeRemaining</li>
        <li>ADNumImagesCounter</li>
        <li>ADFrameType</li>
        <li>ADArrayCallbacks</li>
        <li>ADFileWriteMode</li>
        <li>ADFileNumCapture</li>
        <li>ADFileNumCaptured</li>
        <li>ADFileCapture</li>
      </ul>
      ADArrayCallbacks can be set to 0 to disable callbacks with detector data. For the
      MarCCD and Pilatus detectors setting this to 0 will disable reading the disk files
      after collection. This can be used to reduce overhead when EPICS is being used just
      for control, rather than to access the data. </li>
    <li>Added variant of NDPluginDriver::createFileName that returns the filePath and
      fileName separately, rather than a complete file name including the path.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 1-2 (24-October-2008)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Major update to documentation</li>
    <li>Significant enhancement to ROI plugin. Added net counts, ROI highlighting.</li>
    <li>Added driver for Pilatus detectors. This has undergone limited testing.</li>
    <li>Added driver for ADSC detectors (done by Lewis Muir, IMCA-CAT)</li>
    <li>Removed separate readback parameters in drivers and template files</li>
    <li>Changed from mbbi/mbbo records to bi/bo records where possible now that the asynInt32
      interface supports bi/bo records.</li>
    <li>Internals
      <ul>
        <li>Renamed asynParamBase to asynPortDriver.</li>
        <li>Renamed NDArrayBase to NDArrayDriver</li>
        <li>Renamed NDPluginBase to NDPluginDriver</li>
        <li>Renamed NDArrayBuff to NDArrayPool, now in NDArray.cpp.</li>
        <li>Renamed ADDriverBase to ADDriver</li>
        <li>Removed ADUtils</li>
        <li>The asynHandle interface in asyn was renamed to asynGenericPointer, many changes
          to incorporate this.</li>
        <li>Base class constructor no longer initializes all asyn interfaces, only the selected
          ones.</li>
        <li>NDArray pool is no longer global, each server creates its own pool if needed.</li>
        <li>Implemented real routines for writeInt32, writeFloat64, and writeOctet in asynPortDriver.cpp,
          removed them from ADDriver.cpp where they were not needed.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 1-1 (10-May-2008)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Major rewrite. Converted device drivers and plugins from C to C++ with C++ base
      classes that handle many of the details of asyn and of callbacks and threading for
      plugins.</li>
    <li>Everything except device drivers and top-level EPICS databases and channel access
      clients are now fully N-dimensional, not restricted to 2-D.</li>
    <li>NDPluginFile now uses netCDF format, which is a portable self-describing binary
      file format.</li>
    <li>Added NDPluginROI which implements region-of-interest.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 style="text-align: center">
    Release 1-0 (11-Apr-2008)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Initial release, still many things remaining to be done.</li>
  </ul>
