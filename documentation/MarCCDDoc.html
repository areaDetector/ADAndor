    Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This is a driver for the MarCCD detectors from <a href="http://www.mar-usa.com/">Rayonix/MarUSA</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The interface to the detector is via a TCP/IP socket interface to the <b>marccd_server_socket</b>
    server that MarUSA provides. The marccd_server_socket program must be started before
    the areaDetector software is started, by running the marccd program and executing
    Acquire/Remote Control/Start.
  </p>
  <p>
    marccd must be using Version 1 of the remote protocol. This is normally done done
    by editing the file marccd/configuration/marccd.conf and replacing the line</p>
  <pre>include marccd_server_v0.conf
    </pre>
  <p>
    with</p>
  <pre>include marccd_server_v1.conf
    </pre>
  <p>
    The file marccd_server_v1.conf should contain the lines:</p>
  <pre>remote_mode_server_command /home/marccd/contrib/marccd_server/marccd_server_socket
remote_mode_server_arguments 2222
    </pre>
  <p>
    The first line points to the location of the marccd_server_socket program that is
    used to implement remote control. In order to work with the areaDetector driver
    this must be a version of this program created after November 11, 2008 when support
    for the <code>get_frameshift</code> command was added. A recent version of this
    program can be downloaded from the <a href="ftp://ftp.rayonix.com/pub/marccd/example_marccd_server.tgz">
      Rayonix FTP site</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The marccd program saves the data to disk as TIFF files. The areaDetector software
    reads these disk files in order to read the data, because marccd does not provide
    another mechanism to access the data.
  </p>
  <p>
    This driver inherits from <a href="areaDetectorDoc.html#ADDriver">ADDriver</a>.
    It implements many of the parameters in <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/asyn_n_d_array_driver_8h.html">
      asynNDArrayDriver.h</a> and in <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/_a_d_driver_8h.html">
        ADArrayDriver.h</a>. It also implements a number of parameters that are specific
    to the MarCCD detectors. The <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/classmar_c_c_d.html">
      marCCD class documentation</a> describes this class in detail.</p>

          is 1 then the status will not indicate that the system is idle when acquisition
          is complete, because the driver polling stops before the file is written. This record

    It is useful to use NDPluginROI to define an ROI containing the entire marccd detector.
    The MaxValue_RBV PV in this ROI can be monitored to make sure that the 16-bit limit
    of 65,535 is not being approached in any pixel.

    The MarCCD driver implements the following parameters in addition to those in asynNDArrayDriver.h
    and ADDriver.h. Note that to reduce the width of this table the parameter index
    variable names have been split into 2 lines, but these are just a single name, for

          The marccd server has 5 tasks (Acquire, Readout, Correct, Write, Dezinger) that
          can overlap their operation. The areaDetector driver can exploit this to improve
          performance in some circumstances. If this parameter is set to 1 (Overlap) then
          the ADAcquire parameter will go to 0 (Done) when the Readout task is done executing,
          but before the Correct and Write tasks have finished correcting and saving the file
          to disk. This improves performance because the next image can begin as soon as ADAcquire
          goes to done, and hence before the previous image is written to disk. Note, however
          that this parameter must be set to 0 (Sequential) if callbacks are being used to
          compute ROIs that are being used in data collection, e.g. in a scan. If this is
          not done then the ROI information will be grabbed before it is updated and incorrect

          marccd can be used for time-resolved studies by collecting multiple data sets before
          reading out the detector. This is done by placing a mask in front of the detector
          that restricts the x-rays to horizontal stripe. An exposure is made, and then an
          external signal causes the detector to shift the image by the number of lines given
          by this parameter. A number of images separated by times of a few milliseconds can
          be collected, and then the detector is read out. Set this parameter to 0 to disable

          The following text is from a document describing baseline stabilization from Rayonix.
          "Baseline stabilization is an optional addition to the marccd data collection software.
          This software option stabilizes the baseline offset level of each CCD image to a
          more accurate value than only the analog electronics provide. This feature is important
          in any type of measurement that requires comparisons between successive data frames
          that include, for example, subtracting (or adding) two data frames, such as one
          often must do in small angle scattering experiments. Baseline instability can make
          it appear that there are slightly more or slightly less X-rays across the entire
          detector (or readout channel) in a data frame. That is different than the read noise,
          which has no net effect on the average. A stable baseline is less critical for data
          analysis in which a background value is calculated by measuring the background around
          each individual spot on the same data frame (typically done in single crystal crystallography
          experiments). The baseline level of a CCD is usually established by measuring an
          analog voltage of the readout amplifier, and the "zero" level can drift over time
          due to ambient temperature changes or other electronic instability. The time scale
          on which the drift occurs is usually greater than about 20 minutes or so; therefore,
          the marccd software default for recollecting background images is every 20 minutes
          or once every data segment in a dataset. Expected baseline stability improvement
          Whereas the older MarCCD detectors had a baseline stability that was only good to
          about &plusmn;1-2 ADU, the SX Series and MX Series detectors have improved electronic
          baseline stability, closer to &plusmn;0.5 ADU. When this Baseline Stabilization
          software option is used, the baseline can be improved much further, with baseline
          stability as low as about &plusmn;0.01 ADU. CCD overscan The method of improving
          the baseline is by an overscan technique. When this option is "on", extra blank
          pixels are read out from the CCD after each line of the CCD is read out from the
          serial register. In the marccd program memory, a temporary data frame which is larger
          than the normal data frame is recorded, and the pixels outside the imaging area
          are used to compute the baseline. These blank pixels do not correspond to any real
          region of the CCD; they are just a result of telling the readout electronics to
          readout with no charge present.<br />
          The user must also enter a target baseline stability value. This number represents
          the accuracy to which the program will try to stabilize the baseline, in ADU (analog-to-digital
          units). The resulting data frame will have a baseline value that is approximately
          the corrected_frame_bias, typically 10 or 100, plus or minus the target baseline
          stability value. For example, if the user enters 0.1, and the corrected_frame_bias
          is 10 (i.e. images with no X-rays normally have a baseline around 10 ADU), then
          a data frame with X-rays will result in a baseline value of approximately 10 &plusmn;0.1
          ADU (and each individual pixel will also have contributions due to X-rays and read
          noise). The accuracy limit of this software feature is about 0.01 ADU, so any target
          value entered between 0 and 0.01 is automatically converted to the limit, 0.01 ADU.
          Entering a target value of 0 is equivalent to turning off the baseline stabilization."

    <li>Capture or stream file saving (NDFileWriteMode, NDFileCapture, NDNumCapture, NDNumCaptured)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="Configuration">
    Configuration</h2>
  <p>
    The marCCD driver is created with the marCCDConfig command, either from C/C++ or
    from the EPICS IOC shell.</p>

    The following show the MEDM screens that are used to control the MarCCD detector.
    Note that the general purpose screen ADBase.adl can be used, but it exposes many
    controls that are not applicable to the MarCCD, and lacks some fields that are important
    for the MarCCD.</p>

  <h2 id="Restrictions">
    Restrictions</h2>
  <p>
    The following are some current restrictions of the MarCCD driver:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The marccd program can save files in many different formats, with TIFF being the
      default. The areaDetector driver can only read TIFF files, not other formats.
    </li>
    <li>The areaDetector driver can in principle be run on machines other than the Linux
      machine running marccd, since the connection is via a socket. It has only been tested
      on Linux.</li>
    <li>The MarCCD driver keeps retrying to read each TIFF file until the modification
      date of the TIFF file is <i>after</i> the time that the exposure command was issued.
      If it did not do this check then it could be reading and displaying old files that
      happen to have the same name as the current files being collected. This check requires
      that the computer that is running the soft IOC must have its clock well synchronized
      with the clock on the computer on which the files are being written (i.e. the computer
      generating the file modification time). If the clocks are not synchronized then
      the files may appear to be stale when they are not, and the driver will time out.
      The driver actually tolerates up to 10 second clock skew betweeen the computers
      but any more than this may lead to problems.</li>
    <li>The following items are hardcoded in the driver. They can be changed by recompiling
      compiling if necessary.
      <ul>
        <li>MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE=256 The maximum size of message to/from marccd_socket_server.</li>
        <li>MAX_FILENAME_LEN=256 The maximum size of a complete file name including path and
          extension.</li>
        <li>MARCCD_SERVER_TIMEOUT=1.0 Timeout when communicating with marccd_socket_server.</li>
        <li>FILE_READ_DELAY=.01 seconds. The time between polling to see if the TIFF file
          exists or if it is the expected size.</li>
        <li>MARCCD_POLL_DELAY=.01 seconds. The time between polling the marccd_socket_server
          status to see when a task has completed.</li>
      </ul>
