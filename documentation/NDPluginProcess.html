    Overview
  </h2>
  <p>
    NDPluginProcess performs arithmetic processing on NDArray data. It performs the
    following operations in the order listed. Each of these operations can be individually
    enabled and disabled.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Subtracts a background array which has been previously acquired.</li>
    <li>Divides by a flat field array which has been previously acquired, and then multiplies
      by a flat field scale factor.</li>
    <li>Multiplies by a scale factor and adds an offset.</li>
    <li>Clips to a minimum specified value.</li>
    <li>Clips to a minimum specified value.</li>
    <li>Applies a recursive digital filter.</li>
    <li>Converts to the specified output data type.</li>
    <li>Exports the processed data as a new NDArray object.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    If any of the above operations is enabled, then the array is first converted to
    NDFloat64 data type, i.e. double-precision float. The operations are all performed
    in double-precision, and then the array is converted to the specified output data
    type.
  </p>
  <p>
    NDPluginProcess is both a <b>recipient</b> of callbacks and a <b>source</b> of NDArray
    callbacks. This means that other plugins, such the NDPluginStdArrays, NDPluginStats,
    and NDPluginFile plugins can be connected to an NDPluginProcess plugin, in which
    case they will use the processed data.
  </p>
  <p>
    NDPluginProcess is fully N-dimensional. It can be used for 2-D images, 3-D (color)
    images, or any type of N-dimensional data.
  </p>
  <p>
    NDPluginProcess inherits from NDPluginDriver. The <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_n_d_plugin_process.html">
      NDPluginProcess class documentation</a> describes this class in detail.
  </p>
  <p>
    NDPluginProcess.h defines the following parameters. It also implements all of the
    standard plugin parameters from <a href="pluginDoc.html#NDPluginDriver">NDPluginDriver</a>.
    The EPICS database NDProcess.template provide access to these parameters, listed
    in the following table. Note that to reduce the width of this table the parameter
    index variable names have been split into 2 lines, but these are just a single name,
    for example <code>NDPluginProcessSaveBackground</code>.

          Processing this record will enable Offset and Scale calculations, and set the Offset=-min(Array)
          and Scale=MaxScale/(max(Array)-min(Array)), where MaxScale is the maximum value
          of the output data type. The output array will thus be scaled to completely fill
          the range of the output data type. Note that the calculation of the offset and scale
          factors is only done once when this record is processed, and these values are used
          for subsequent array callbacks, i.e. it does not autoscale on each array callback.
          Thanks to Tom Cobb for this addition.

  <h3>
    Recursive filter implementation</h3>
  <p>
    The recursive filter performs filtering in the time (not spatial) domain. It is
    implemented in a fairly general manner, so that a variety of filters can be implemented.
    These include integrating filters and differentiating filter types. The recursive
    filter stores one "filter" array internally. Using this internal filter array, and
    a new input array, it computes an output array, and a new version of the filter
    array. The equations governing the output array and new filter array are:
  </p>
  <pre>
O[n] = OOffset + OScale*((OC1 + OC2/N)*F[n-1] +
                         (OC3 + OC4/N)*I[n])
F[n] = FOffset + FScale*((FC1 + FC2/N)*F[n-1] +
                         (FC3 + FC4/N)*I[n])
On filter reset
F[0] = ROffset + RC1*F[0] + RC2*I[0] 
  
where
  I[n] = New input array from callback
  I[0] = First input array after a filter reset
F[n-1] = Stored filter array
  F[n] = New filter array
  F[0] = Current filter array when filter is reset.  
         May be a copy of I[0] if there was no valid filter array.
     N = Current value of NumFiltered
  O[n] = Output array passed to clients
</pre>
  <h3>
    Predefined filters</h3>
  <p>
    The NDProcess.template database implements the following predefined filters using
    the $(P)$(R)FilterType record. The implementation of these predefined filter types
    is done entirely in the database, not in the plugin code. The database simply downloads
    values of OC1-OC4, FC1-FC4, and RC1-RC2 that result in predefined filter behaviours.
    The operation of the recursive filter is by no means limited to these fixed filter
    types, they are simply provided as a convenience, and can be easily modified or
    extended. Note that the database does not download values of OOffset, OScale, FOffset,
    FScale, or ROffset, so these remain unchanged when a new filter is selected. The
    equations below do not include these offset and scale values, but they are useful
    in many circumstances.</p>
  <p>
    The NDProcess_settings.req file for save/restore saves the values of all of the
    filter coefficients, and downloads them when EPICS initialized at iocInit. It also
    saves the FilterType, but does not process this record at iocInit, so that any customized
    filter coefficients will be preserved, and will not be replaced by the defaults
    for that filter type.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Recursive Average</h4>
  <p>
    The recursive average filter does input array averaging. It is defined as:</p>
  <pre>
O[n] = F[n] = (1-1/N)*F[n-1] + 1/N*I[n]
</pre>
  <p>
    N is the characteristic number of arrays in the average. For example, if N=100,
    then each new array is weighted by 0.01 and the previous filter value is weighted
    by 0.99. This is an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter, because the effect of
    one array never complelely dissappears, but rather decays exponentially. When this
    filter is reset the filter array is initialized with the first input array. This
    filter can be used to decrease the noise and increase the dynamic range of a repetitive
    input signal with a small signal. In that case it can be useful to use set EnableOffsetScale=Enable
    and set Scale to a large enough number to more fully use the dynamic range of the
    output data type. The averaged signal will then better use the dynamic range of
    the output data type.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Average</h4>
  <p>
    The average filter does input array averaging. It is defined as:</p>
  <pre>
O[n] = F[n] = F[n-1] + 1/N*I[n]
</pre>
  <p>
    N is the number of arrays in the average. For example, if N=100, then each new array
    is weighted by 0.01. When this filter is reset the filter array is initialized to
    0. This filter typically cannot be run forever, because the output grows monotonically
    and will lead to overflow. However, if AutoResetFilter is enabled then the filter
    will be reset when NumFiltered=NumFilter. If ArrayCallbacks is "Array N only" then
    callbacks will be done only with the final averaged value.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Sum</h4>
  <p>
    The sum filter does input array summing. It is defined as:</p>
  <pre>
O[n] = F[n] = F[n-1] + I[n]
</pre>
  <p>
    This filter simply computes the sum of input arrays. When this filter is reset the
    filter array is initialized to 0. It is often necessary to set the output data type
    to one with a larger maximum value than the input array to prevent overflow. If
    AutoResetFilter is enabled then the filter will be reset when NumFiltered=NumFilter.
    If ArrayCallbacks is "Array N only" then callbacks will be done only with the final
    summed value.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Difference</h4>
  <p>
    The difference filter computes the difference between frame N and frame N-1. It
    is defined as:</p>
  <pre>
O[n] = -F[n-1] + I[n]
F[n] = I[n]
</pre>
  <p>
    Note that the difference will often be a small signed number. If the output datatype
    is unsigned, or if a display client expects unsigned numbers, then it can be useful
    to set OOffset to a non-zero value to add an offset to the result. For example,
    if the output data type is UInt8 (unsigned 8-bit), then setting OOffset to 128 will
    produce an unsigned image centered at 128. Similarly OScale can be used to increase
    the range of the difference by multiplying by a factor greater than 1, although
    this will not increase the dynamic range of the result, only the absolute range.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Recursive Average Difference</h4>
  <p>
    This filter computes the difference between frame N and the recursive average of
    previous frames. It is a combination of the Difference and Recursive Average filters
    described above. The new filter is a recursive average, but the output is the difference
    between the current frame and that recursive average. It is defined as:</p>
  <pre>
O[n] = -F[n-1] + I[n]
F[n] = (1-1/N)*F[n-1] + 1/N*I[n]
</pre>
  <p>
    N is again the characteristic number of arrays in the average.
  </p>
  <h4>
    Copy to Filter</h4>
  <p>
    This filter simply copies the input array to the filter array and the output array.
    It is defined as:</p>
  <pre>
O[n] = F[n] = I[n]
</pre>
  <p>
    This filter can be used to load the filter (F) with a certain array, which is then
    subsequently used for some other filter type.</p>
  <h2 id="Configuration">
    Configuration</h2>
  <p>
    The NDPluginProcess plugin is created with the NDProcessConfigure command, either
    from C/C++ or from the EPICS IOC shell.</p>
  <pre>
NDProcessConfigure(const char *portName, int queueSize, int blockingCallbacks,
                   const char *NDArrayPort, int NDArrayAddr,
                   int maxBuffers, size_t maxMemory,
                   int priority, int stackSize)
  </pre>
  <p>
    For details on the meaning of the parameters to this function refer to the detailed
    documentation on the NDProcessConfigure function in the <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/_n_d_plugin_process_8cpp.html">
      NDPluginProcess.cpp documentation</a> and in the documentation for the constructor

  <p>
    The following is the MEDM screen that provides access to the parameters in NDPluginDriver.h
    and NDPluginProcess.h through records in NDPluginBase.template and NDProcess.template.
    In this example the input image is first offset by -4 and scaled by 35. That result
    is then clipped to a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 255. The image is then run through
    a recursive averaging filter with N=100.
